**Request Service**


A ticket is a method for a user to submit a service request, and a ticket service request provides a non-standardized resource request (for example, a service request for dismounting a service deployment) and a service application requiring IT manual intervention (for example, a user request login password reset).


Specific ticket service function description:


+ Ticket Request: Supports users to apply for ticket services in the service catalog.


+ Ticket Tracking: After the service catalog request form is completed, it supports the user to enter My Requests to view the service details.


> Below you will be introduced to the detailed steps of the ticket request and tracking process.


# Request Ticket


Users can apply for a configured service or shared service in the service catalog.


1.  Click “Service Catalog” in the left navigation bar, select manual ticket service, click to enter the service request page.


2.  In the service request page, fill in the details of the service: title, ticket description, priority, urgency, applicant, email, mobile phone number.


3. When the administrator has configured additional field information for the form, the user can fill in the required fields on the details page. For example, to apply for a new project, the administrator configures the fields (projects, descriptions, project members) for the form, and the user fills in the relevant information when applying for a new project.


4.  Click Apply and the ticket service is applied successfully.



# Track tickets 


1. After the user initiates the ticket request in the service catalog, according to the pre-configured process of the administrator, the system distributes the ticket to the corresponding service group according to the relationship between the service group and the ticket. After the specified user or role in the service team receives the ticket request, they can take the ticket voluntarily or transfer to others, or process offline, and the ticket status is updated after completion.

2. When the administrator associates the service level agreement for the ticket service, which defines the expected time for the service to complete, both the service initiator and the acceptor can track the service in time to improve service efficiency. The user can view the details of the SLA and the remaining time (the difference from the expected service resolution time at this moment).

3. The system will notify the user via email.

4.  The user can close the service request, the ticket status is changed to processed, and the service request is completed. If the user request to re-process the ticket, the ticket will be returned to the service group for re-processing, and the ticket status is changed to being processed.
