**Cloud Resource Guidelines**


The Cloud Resource Blueprint Service is based on blueprint modeling to define standard service frameworks and components, providing a rich set of out-of-the-box software components to visualize blueprints for automated deployment. After the service configuration is completed, the service is released as a service card, and the user applies for the cloud resource blueprint service through the service catalog.
For example, configuring a vSphere single-node virtual machine service is a typical scenario for a cloud resource blueprint service.
The following describes the specific operations of service request and service deployment.
# Service Request

## Fast Service Request

Users can select quick request in the service catalog. No need for service configuration, just select the required blueprint, and directly apply for service for automated deployment.
E.g:

+ Enter the service catalog. You can view the service card for the request database. The database service is bundled with multiple blueprints including: all pure database blueprints, Oracle (including clustered), MySQL (including clustered), MongoDB, DB2, SQL Server. .

+ Click on “Apply Database” to select the required blueprint to quickly apply for automated deployment.

 

## Service Catalog Request	

Users can apply for configured services or shared services published by the business group in the service catalog.

 Click “Service Catalog” in the left navigation bar, select a service, and click to enter the service application page.

 The details of the service are displayed at the top of the service request page:

Service Request - Service Details 
 
 +   Description:              Description of the service
 +   Basic information:        Service lease time and retention time configured by service configuration/business group configuration
 +   Topology:                 Topology diagram used by the service
 +   Component Configuration:  All components in the service topology diagram can be expanded to view the configuration information of each component
 +   Process Control:          Deployment/ Pre-dismounting/post-operation set on service configuration/business groups, and whether approval and email notification are required

  Fill in the relevant request parameters below the service request page:


+ Organization information
Business group:	If the service is a full business group, that is, a shared service, you need to select a business group (this business group needs to have a related resource bundle, otherwise it will not be allowed to apply); if the service has been assigned a business group, the business group does not need to be filled out.
Project:	If the project is divided under the business group, you can select the project.
Owner:	Select the owner of the service, the owner must be a member of the business group


+ Deployment information
Name:	If the service deployment name naming rule is configured for the business group, the service deployment name does not need to be filled in. The service deployment name is automatically generated according to the business group rules.If the business group name is not configured in the business group, you need to manually fill in the service.
Quantity:	Fill in the number of deployments, the default is 1
Execution time:	Can start service deployment at a specified time, accurate to the minute


+ Other information
Key-value label:	Checked by default, all server nodes use the same key-value label. If not checked, all server nodes under the service deployment will be listed, and key value labels can be set separately for each server node.
All Server nodes:	If you check the key-value label, you can set the key-value label for all server nodes.
Remarks:	Optional
Attachments:	Select a file as an attachment
Field information:	Fill in additional custom fields in the Service Design - Form interface


+ Request Parameters
Request Parameters:	If during service configuration, only "Allow modification" is selected (“Modify only when approved” is not checked), the application parameter field will appear. You can configure the relevant Server and Network parameters as required. 
Software Configuration:	If the “Add Software during request” is selected during service configuration, the software configuration bar will appear. You can add software to the computing node/software component of the service and click “Add Software”.
	Select the software to be installed and all software components will be listed
	Select relationship: “Install to” or “Depend on”
	Select the node to install to or depend on


 After completing the request, click “Apply” to directly deploy or wait for approval according to the business group process control. You can view the deployment status in “Deployments” - “My Deployments” (you can also view the deployment in the operation history in the upper right corner) or go to "Requests" - "My Requests" to view the approval process.

 ### Auto-fill

 When you apply for the service, if you cannot fill in the relevant parameters at one time, click “Save” to save the filled parameters, and at the next application, click “Load” to reload which will automatically fill the last filled in parameters. 

 ### Estimate Cost

 When you apply for a service, the platform can display the cost of this application (on a monthly basis).
	For the private cloud, after the administrator configures the accounting rules of the private cloud in the “Billing & Usage”-“Billing Rules”, the user directly uses the charging API to perform charging when applying for the service.。
	The public cloud needs to cache the public cloud's unit price API structure and then calculate the cost.
