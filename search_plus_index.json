Tenants are the architectural units in SmartCMP. In a SmartCMP deployment, multiple tenants can be configured. Tenants provide isolation boundaries for resource usage and management configurations. The dedicated configuration in each tenant is listed below: Logo and theme color: Different logo and theme color schemes can be customized for each tenant and configured in the management control interface. User: Each tenant has independent user management. You can create a local user while users of tenant A can only access tenant A and cannot access other tenants. You can also configure each tenant with a directory service for authentication, like Microsoft Active Directory or another LDAP server. Multiple tenants can use the same directory service, but the same user can belong to only one tenant, and users with the same ID cannot be configured in different tenants. Entitlement: Each tenant has an independent entitlement configuration. The permissions configured in tenant A are limited to the scope of tenant A and do not work for other tenants. Workflow: Each tenant administrator can configure workflows, such as approval processes, service processes, etc., to be applied within the scope of this tenant. Cloud platform management and resource bundle configuration: Each tenant admin or infrastructure admin can connect and manage the cloud platform portals required for the tenant, such as VMware vCenter, AWS/Azure/Alibaba cloud, etc. You can configure and manage different cloud platform portals in different tenants, or you can share the same cloud platform portals by configuring different resource bundles to access different computing resources (for example, different clusters in vCenter) for users in different tenants. Service Catalog: Each tenant's architect can design a service blueprint for the tenant. The administrator publishes the service catalog that the user can self-request according to different departments and environments. Categories and service items in the service catalog remain independent among different tenants. Tenant Single tenant and multiple tenants Single tenant In single tenant deployment, all configurations appear in the default tenant. Administrators can manage cloud resources and organizational structures and configure specific service catalogs within tenants. Multiple tenants In multi-tenant environment, each tenant has a separate configuration that is managed by the administrator. System administrators can configure, view and manage configurations in multiple tenants. Business group and projects Within each tenant, different organizational structures may be created including business groups and projects. Business group A business group is a logical organizational structure within a tenant. User can creates a corresponding business group for a company's department, organization, or business unit. Tenant administrators can create multi-level business groups, and users associated with business groups can use resources and services in the business group. Independent rules, processes, and resources can be configured for each business group: Associate one or more resource bundles with each business group Associate users with each business group. Configure different approval processes, operation permissions, cloud resource usage leases, cloud resource naming specifications, etc. Project In SmartCMP, cloud resources within a project are visible to all members of the project and are invisible to all members of other projects. A project is subordinate to a business group and can contain multiple users. A user can join multiple projects. Role A role consists of a set of permissions that can be associated with a user to determine the functions that the user can manage, configure, and use in SmartCMP. Based on individual responsibilities, each user can be associated with one or more roles, and the permissions will be a superposition of those roles. After deployment of SmartCMP, following roles will be provided by default: Tenant roles overview A tenant-wide role has the corresponding responsibilities of that particular tenant and does not affect other tenants in the system. You can create custom roles as needed to be associated with users. Tenant Admin Usually responsible for the overall tenant structure. Tenant administrators configure SmartCMP based on their tenants' internal organizational needs, responsible for tenant internal process and policy configuration, organizational structure configuration, user and permission configuration, and more. Main duty: Create and manage users and tenant roles, assign roles and permissions to users and create service teams Create and manage business groups and assign business group administrators to each business group Create and manage service processes and approval processes Perform tenant system configuration, including catalog service information, mail system information, access to dashboards and reports, etc. Software Architect Usually responsible for designing services that companies and organizations need to apply for and use. Services come in a variety of styles, from a single virtual machine to complex applications including network load balancing, web applications, and databases. Main duty: Create and manage software components Create and modify blueprints, model them according to business needs, and define the components included in the blueprint, including infrastructure components and software components Publish a blueprint Unpublish and delete blueprints that need to be removed Infrastructure administrator The infrastructure administrator connects one or more cloud platforms to each tenant, manages virtual machine templates (that is, operating system images) in the cloud platform, and calculates specifications (that is, instance types). Create a resource pool, specify the infrastructure resources of each cloud platform, and assign them to the business group for use. At the same time, according to the blueprint designed by the software architect, infra admin can make configurations for different business groups or environment requirements and publish to service catalog. Main duty: Connect cloud platform Create and distribute resource bundles and manage cloud platform and inventory cloud resources Configure and manage VM templates (that is, operating system images) of the cloud platform and computing specifications (that is, instance types). Manage IP address pool Configure and publish services based on blueprints released by software architects Manage service catalog Analyze resource utilization and recycle expired resources Business group roles overview A role on a business group scope has the corresponding responsibilities of that particular business group and does not affect other business groups. BG admin Manage one or more business groups, usually department managers. Main duty: Add users to business group and associate roles Configure policies such as lease duration and naming specification for cloud resources Configure business group cloud resource operation entitlement and service deployment operation entitlement, specify the operations that the user can perform (such as powering on and off, adding disks, adjusting configuration, etc.) and the required approval process Create a project and assign a project administrator Monitor resource utilization in the business group. If resources are scarce, you can apply for resource expansion BG member All users in a business group can request services published to the business group (including services shared to all business groups). Users can request services from the service catalog and manage the resources they own. Main duty: Self-service request. Check configuration and monitoring information of owned cloud resources to perform self-service operation (the operation entitlement is configured by business group). Self-service alert setting for the cloud resources it owns. Project roles overview A role on a project scope has the corresponding responsibility for that particular project and does not affect other projects. Project Admin Manage one or more projects, usually project managers. Main duty: Add users to the project and associate roles View cloud resources owned by the project Project member Project member is also a member of the business group to which the project belongs, so it can request publishing services to the business group and can view resources and perform operations. At the same time,all members of the same project can view the resources in this project. Service Group Service group is a collection of service personnel who process request services during the request service management process. Tenant administrators can create one or more service groups and assign members to each service group. Main duty: After the user applies for the manual work order service that needs manual intervention through the service catalog, according to the pre-configured service process, the corresponding service group will receive the work order for processing. After receiving the work order, the personnel in the service group can transfer, or perform offline processing, update the work order status after completing the task, and return the work order to the request user for confirmation and closure.

After connecting the cloud platform, you can distribute resources such as calculation, storage, and network through resource bundles to be assigned to different service groups. At the same time, you can create virtual machine templates and computing specifications (that is, instance types) in SmartCMP, and encapsulate and abstract virtual machine templates (or operating system images) and computing specifications (that is, instance types) of each cloud platform for unified management and automated calls. Cloud platform You can enter access information for each cloud platform in SmartCMP to connect and manage. For example, virtualization management controller address, username and password, or public cloud access key. The following table lists the information that needs to be entered for each cloud platform portal: Cloud Platform Type Connect Method vSphere vCenter Server OpenStack OpenStack Management Controller PowerVC PowerVC Management Controller Hyper-V Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager(SCVMM) Server Physical Machine SmartCMP physical server management node information Aliyun Aliyun Service Account AccessKey AWS AWS Service Account AccessKey Microsoft Azure Azure API Access Credentials Tencent Cloud Tencent Cloud Service Account AccessKey QingCloud QingCloud Service Account AccessKey VMware NSX NSX Management Controller Cisco ACI ACI Management Controller F5 F5 Management Controller Cloud Gateways The enterprise's infrastructure and network environment are relatively complex. There are scenarios such as isolation between multiple data centers, virtual network environments, and hybrid cloud architecture. Based on this, SmartCMP uses a distributed architecture and connects to different network environments with the help of cloud gateways to monitor and manage the resources in each VPC, data center, or cloud environment. Users only need to create and manage a cloud gateway for each data center, VPC, or remote site for connection and communication. Resource Bundle In a resource bundle, you can specify a set of resource objects in the cloud platform as resource portals for deploying virtual machines or other cloud resources. The resource object can be a cluster of computers in a virtualization platform or an area of a public cloud. Resources, such as computing, storage, and network, are classified and specified through resource bundles,and are distributed to different business groups for consumption and use by members in the business group. For example, you can assign different datastores and virtual switches in a vSphere cluster to different resource bundles, allowing different departments to deploy resources using different storage and networks. Or specify public-cloud-specific zones, availability zones, and VPC to enable the public cloud services deployed through the resource bundle to uniformly use the resources of the available area and isolate network from other services through VPC. The following table lists the resource entrance configurations for each cloud platform resource bundle: Cloud Platform Type Resource Bundle Entrance vSphere vSphere Cluster OpenStack OpenStack Availability Zone PowerVC PowerVC Availability Zone Hyper-V Hyper-V Cluster Aliyun Aliyun Zone, Availability Zone, and VPC AWS AWS Zone, Availability Zone, and VPC Microsoft Azure Azure Subscription ID, zone, and resource group QingCloud QingCloud Zone, Availability Zone, and VPC One or more resource bundles (including multiple resource bundles from the same cloud platform) can be associated with each business group. At the same time, each resource bundle can be assigned to one business group or shared to multiple or all service groups. You can: Specify the computing resources of the virtualization platform, or the area of the public cloud, the availability zone, etc. Set the available resource quota, including the number of CPUs, the amount of memory, the number of virtual machines that can be deployed, etc. Specify specific storage resources and network resources Manually import the inventory resources in the cloud platform or set a timing policy to automatically synchronize the inventory resources in the cloud platform. For example, you can create a vSphere resource bundle: Specify a vSphere cluster in the managed vCenter to provide computing resources; Set the resource quota of the resource bundle: the number of CPUs, the amount of memory, the number of virtual machines that can be deployed, the number of snapshots allowed, and so on; Specify the data stores that can be used and set the storage space available for each data store; Specify the virtual switch that can be used and set the IP address allocation method. Virtual Machine Template You can define one or more operating systems (such as CentOS) in SmartCMP. Operating system is a logical concept. Each operating system can be associated with templates or images from different cloud platforms (for example, a CentOS virtual machine template in vCenter, or a CentOS image in Aliyun). Operating system and virtual machine templates will be used when the service is configured. Computing Specification Computing specification defines the configuration specifications of the computer CPU and memory. On SmartCMP, like the operating system, computing specification is a logical concept, and you can associate specifications or instance types in different cloud platforms for each computing specification (such as specifications in the OpenStack platform, or instance types in the AWS public cloud). Wait). Computing specifications and cloud platform specifications will be used during service configuration. Through the abstraction of the operating system and computing specifications, you can create different operating systems as needed to associate virtual machine templates that conform to enterprise security specifications. At the same time, create different computing specifications and specify specific instance types (such as reserved instance types that have been purchased). You can specify the operating system and virtual machine templates when the service is being configured and publish standardized services for users to apply. IP Address Management You can create and manage IP pools to automate the allocation of IP addresses when deploying cloud resources. IP pools can support multi-cloud heterogeneous environments, for example creating an IP pool and assigning it to vSphere and OpenStack platforms at the same time. With IP address management, you can view the utilization of IP addresses, history logs, and manually occupy and release IP addresses. Copyright © 2016-2020 CloudChef. All Rights Reserved.

These services can be infrastructure services (such as virtual machines, firewalls, DNS, etc.), application services (such as databases, or integrated applications including network load balancing, Web components, and databases), etc. Manual Request Service: Services that are not standardized and require manual intervention and support, including service requests, event handling, and so on. For example, if the user forgets the password which needs to be reset or submits a request to open an email or account or encounters an IT service problem which needs to be resolved (the server, printer or network cannot be accessed, etc.). The user can initiate a work order request service through the service catalog, and the service team will receive the request and process. The following diagram depicts the logical connections between components, blueprints, services, and deployments. Components include software components and infrastructure components. Software architect builds the topology map of the application and configures resources and parameters for the service, publishing the service card to the service catalog. Members of the business group apply for self-service in the service catalog according to actual needs, and the services are automatically combined according to policies and specifications to complete automated deployment and delivery. Component Any resource is a component object. Whether it is software, infrastructure or container resources, different types of cloud resources are component objects and can be componentized. The definition of components adopts an object-oriented design method, uses a unified data structure for modeling, and standardizes configuration properties. SmartCMP provides not only built-in rich component resources and common operations, but also highly scalable capabilities, flexibly add component resources and configure operations according to user needs. Rich component library: component resources out of the box. SmartCMP cloud management platform has a large number of commonly used component resources built in, including IaaS (cloud hosts, networks, storage, etc. of different cloud platforms), PaaS (servers, databases, RDS, etc.), containers (Kubernetes, Docker), software (MySQL, Oracle, Nginx, etc.) and agents (monitoring agents, automation agents). Different types of resources are created and managed in a unified interface, using a tree-like grouping directory, supporting custom component grouping, supporting secondary editing, fast copying, Import and export components. 「Note」Detailed creation and management steps please refer to: component library Custom components: Users can create reusable components according to their needs, componentize any resource, and standardize the process of configuring components, including defining resource types, versions, attributes, component operations, etc., and all configuration interfaces are open to user customization. For example, when a DBA creates a database cluster and an Oracle database needs to be deployed, DBA can add Oracle components to the component library and configure components according to requirements, including configuring component profiles, instructions, properties, scripts, and operations (create, start, stop, restart, delete, etc. the specified database) 「Note」 For detailed steps of the custom component, please refer to: Creating a component Component builds up blueprint A component is the basic unit that makes up a blueprint. The components in SmartCMP consist of two types: Infrastructure components: including computing components (e.g., virtual machines, containers, etc.), network components (e.g., load balancing, security groups, firewalls, etc.), storage components (e.g., disks, object storage, etc.). These components are built into SmartCMP and can be selected during blueprint design. Software components: for the installation of application software, including middleware, relational databases, non-relational databases, and so on. You can standardize configuration properties and use scripts to specify how to install, configure, uninstall, or update components during software deployment (you can also customize the other operations you need). Software architects can create custom components, update existing components, or delete components that have been removed through the software component management interface. Software components can be used with infrastructure components when designing blueprints. 「Note」SmartCMP has a large number of commonly used components built in. When you add custom infrastructure components or software components, you can choose to instantiate them when you add them so that you can also choose them during blueprint design. Object-oriented design The design of components adopts the structure of object-oriented design. Object-oriented has three characteristics of encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. Inheritance allows child categories to have various properties and methods of the parent category without the need to write the same code again. While making the child category inherit the parent category, you can redefine certain properties and rewrite certain methods, that is, to override the original properties and methods of the parent category, so that it has different functions from the parent category. Operations and attributes are inheritable. Start, stop, restart, delete, and refresh the built-in components of the system. (Take the refresh operation as an example, the operation is configured in system in advance, and the implementation methods, scripts, tasks, and parameters necessary for the operation are used.) The built-in operation can be applied to any resource on the platform. Therefore, when the component Oracle is created, the built-in \"start, stop, restart, delete, refresh\" operations are automatically inherited. When the component type Software is selected, the created Oracle component has various attributes of the parent Software component and can also be customized to obtain different functions from the parent one. It should be noted that the attribute key value added by the user and the attribute key value in the parent component cannot be the same, otherwise the attribute definition in the parent component will be overwritten. You can also add a script file by creating a new file, which will be used to extend the component. For example: the custom component Oracle's install.sh script will be associated with the \"create operation\". Encapsulation hides the implementation details of complex operations and only provides public access to the outside world. The platform has complex operations built-in and works out of the box, reducing differences and difficulty in understanding. For example: \"adjust virtual machine configuration\" operation (adjust virtual machine calculation specifications and cloud platform specifications), when the cloud platform type is different, the SmartCMP cloud management platform hides the details of the flow of resource operations, only exposing public access interfaces. For example, the \"Adjust virtual machine configuration\" operation is applied to a virtual machine on the Hyper-V platform and a virtual machine on the OpenStack platform. The specific technical implementation is different, but the user configuration interface displays the same content. Polymorphism refers to the same operation, which has a different effect due to different parameters passed in. For example, when the component Oracle is created, different application systems have specific requirements and custom requirements for Oracle's deployment requirements and parameter control. \"Attributes\" can be set according to the deployment requirements of different systems, by setting custom attributes, exposing configuration parameters that application components need to fill out to the interface configuration, and passing custom parameters. When Oracle is deployed automatically, the SmartCMP cloud management platform automatically invokes relevant parameters to perform application installation and configuration, which meets different requirements for Oracle deployment in different data clusters. Blueprint A blueprint is a complete specification of the overall application, including computing, storage, networking, software, etc., used to determine attributes and dependencies, workflows, and execution strategies for various resources. You can create a standardized service framework by designing blueprint on visualized canvas and combining one or more components. Once the blueprint is published, it can be used to create a service. Blueprints can take many forms, for example, a blueprint may contain: A network component and a virtual machine component A firewall component or a public cloud relational database component Multi-level application architecture, such as: network load balancing, web applications and databases A hybrid orchestration of multiple cloud platform components, such as a web application deployed in Aliyun while a database in a vSphere private cloud, or a web application in a Kubernetes container while a database in an OpenStack private cloud. Workflow Workflow defines the sequence and strategy of activities or tasks performed at each step in the automated process. Workflows in SmartCMP are divided into the following three types. Each type includes a built-in process that can be used directly. These built-in processes cannot be modified or deleted. You can also customize the workflows you need through a visual process designer. Cloud Resource Blueprint Service: Defines the process of automated deployment of cloud resources, including built-in workflows for standard cloud service deployment. Manual Request Service: Defines the task and flow mode of each step of the request service, including built-in workflows such as standard manual requests and standard event management. Approval process: It is used to control whether a user should obtain approval of someone in the organization when applying for service or performing operations on a cloud resource. Please remind that in those versions before 5.1 or those upgraded from the old version, the approval process configuration menu is provided for compatibility with the approval process in the old version. However, this feature will be turned off in the future, and it is recommended that you use workflow to create and manage the approval process. Form When a user requests a service in the service catalog, each service you create and publish displays a form. When creating or configuring each service, you can use the default form. If you need to modify or add additional field information for users to fill in at the time of request, you can customize the form through the form designer. Catalog Group Catalog groups are used to organize different services into related types, making it easier for users to browse the services they need. For example: infrastructure services, database services, manual request services, and more. You can create new groups as needed to categorize the services you need to publish. Service Publishing Tenant administrators or infrastructure administrators can deploy blueprints and workflows that have been released, according to different organizational or departmental requirements, and publish them as services in the service catalog. A service can be published to a business group so that only members of the business group can apply while it can also be posted to all business groups and shared with all members for request. In the process of service configuration: For cloud resource deployment services, you can specify a complete specification of the deployment, such as virtual machine configuration (required virtual machine template, computing size, disk configuration, etc.), lease, operation entitlement, approval process, service workflow, customization forms, etc. For request services, you can specify the service team, approval process, service workflow, custom form, and more for each step of the task. Lease Period Lease period includes the lease time, retention time and recycle bin recovery time: When the lease time expires, all computing resources in the service deployment will be shut down; When the retention time expires, the service deployment will be placed in the recycle bin; In the Recycle Bin, you can restore or manually delete them (the resources will be completely released from the cloud platform). If you do nothing, the resources will be automatically deleted after the reclaim time expires (these resources will be completely released from the cloud platform). Approval Process Approval process can be set up separately in business group and service configuration: Approval process configured by the business group will take effect for all services in the business group; If a service is configured with an approval process separately, the process will override those in the business group. If no process is configured, the approval process for the business group configuration will be used. Service Deployment When user request the cloud resource service, after approval (if the approval process is configured), SmartCMP will be deployed according to the policy and specification of the service configuration, and then delivered to the user for use. Service deployment refers to all cloud resources included in the service requested by the user, such as a virtual machine, a database, or a multi-tiered application environment. Users can use all the resources deployed by the service during the configured service lease period and can self-service operations or changes according to the operation entitlement configured by the administrator. Naming Policies Define the service deployment and cloud resource naming policies through the specification template and configure them globally. All business groups are configured by default. Different business groups can also be individually selected for configuration as needed to override global settings. Use naming policies to standardize the name of the service deployment and the cloud resources, including the service deployment name, instance display name, and Windows or Linux operating system host name (Hostname). To ensure the uniqueness of naming, users can add a naming suffix to the policy. The naming suffix can be a number sequence with a custom length or a random character string with a custom length. User can specify the initialization sequence number for the numeric sequence. For example, user can create a naming suffix with a length of 3 and an initialization sequence number of 1. The instance names deployed by the group will be Dev001, Dev002, and so on. Entitlement Profiles The entitlement profile defines the operations that users can perform on service deployment and cloud resources. Users can configure the approval process and can apply a set of entitlement profiles to all business groups, or allow different business groups to associate entitlement profiles independently template. Entitlement refers to the changes or operations authorized that the user may perform on service deployment or cloud resources. You can disable or enable certain operations and set up approval processes for the enabled operations. There are two types of entitlements: Deployment’s entitlement refers to operations on the service deployment level, including extending the lease period of the service deployment, changing the business group, project, owner, etc. Cloud resource’s entitlement refers to operations on instances or other cloud resources, including power on / off, remote connection, disk addition, migration, etc. In the entitlement profiles interface, multiple sets of entitlement profiles that meet the usage scenario can be created: In the system configuration interface, configure an entitlement profile for all business groups, and all business groups will be configured by default. The entitlement profile configured separately for each business group will take effect for all service deployment and cloud resources for that business group. Copyright © 2016-2020 CloudChef.

The software industry is increasingly aware that in order to deliver software products and services continuously, efficiently, and reliably, DevOps must work closely together to automate software lifecycle management through automated tool collaboration and communication. The core scenarios include: By setting up stages and tasks to automate the packaging of applications, environment deployment, automated testing, etc., configure an automated pipeline for continuous release and continuous deployment that is suitable for the characteristics of the development team. The SmartCMP Application Release Pipeline works seamlessly with continuous integration tools such as Jenkins, Git, and Nexus to automate application deployment and upgrades, and achieve continuous delivery and deployment from development to testing to production. Based on the blueprint, automate the deployment of each application topology blueprint and let the platform automate the triggering of pipelines and execution releases, test, manage product and automate deployment based on policy. Support the deployment of any application to any cloud to open up development, testing, and production environments. Automate online or update applications in production environments with proven architectures, programs, and deployment tools to ensure consistency of cross-cloud deployments and changes, reducing deployment and operational risk. Deployment automation integrates the entire tool chain from an application-centric perspective (automatically completes software development projects including continuous builds, application configuration, product archiving, resource deployment, monitoring operations, etc.), manages and visualizes candidate versions deployment for the entire pipeline, quickly getting the right product deployment to the appropriate environment, thus building a bridge between Dev and Ops. R&D and testers self-apply for cloud resources or services through the SmartCMP service catalog, reducing the time lost in collaboration between DevOps, enabling teams to work together, iterate functions and release products more efficiently. CI/CD Tool Chain SmartCMP integrates a rich CI/CD toolchain to provide code management, continuous build, product management, deployment, monitoring and operation, and more for applications, and provides an open API. All features are based on a comprehensive integration framework that includes mainstream software tools: GitLab, GitHub, Jenkins, Maven, Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Nexus, Kafka, etc., enabling developers to have more efficient code management and operators to change the application with less risk, improving the quality of the application and reducing the risk of deploying features. Pipeline SmartCMP automated pipelines create automated, reusable, secure, and compliant application delivery processes, custom configuration builds, deployments, and end-to-end process governance and control. The pipeline is automated, distributed across different environments and stages and achieves full lifecycle deployment and release management. Both the definition of the pipeline and the execution of the pipeline provide a friendly interactive interface. The configuration of the pipeline can be mastered through simple practice. The pipeline process can also be intuitively sensed during the pipeline operation. The pipeline consists of a series of stages, each consisting of multiple tasks and environments that the software must complete before it is released to production, describing the operations that need to be performed in order to achieve the desired results. Pipelining is built in successive stages that contain one or more parallel or serial tasks. The entire pipeline is defined as follows: Add a pipeline, bind a project, and add global parameters to call in later tasks Customize the trigger condition of the pipeline, like when the pipeline is automatically run. You can manually trigger the pipeline task or set the policy to trigger the pipeline task automatically by the trigger to achieve flexible pipeline trigger conditions. Trigger types include Jenkins triggering; Webhook integration (support Git, Gitlab and other code repository to change triggers); manual triggering;timing triggering. Define stages and tasks based on business needs. Stage A stage is a group of tasks that are parallel or serial. When the current stage of the task meets the rules and execution is completed, it is promoted to the next stage in the pipeline. SmartCMP pipeline supports the customization and assembly of multiple stages and tasks and can add any number of execution tasks in the stage through which it is possible to design development, deployment, and operation pipelines applicable to various scenarios. Based on the secondary development capabilities of SmartCMP, you can expand your needs for more personalized scenarios. The stages are divided into several types, including: Code compilation stage: build binary files. Unit testing stage: Run all unit tests and analyze code quality, such as: development, functional testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), load testing (LT), system integration testing (SIT). Packaging stage: Build the final package, virtual machine image or Docker image. The parameters of the input and output and the execution time can be defined during the execution of the stage task, and the stage can be enabled under the specified conditions. For example, you can define different stages of software packaging, deployment of test environments, and so on. The task types for each stage include Jenkins Job tasks, deploying new application tasks, cloud resource change tasks, script execution tasks, etc. After the pipeline is executed, user can view the execution status of each stage and task, as well as output information. Task Each stage of the task is an activity or job in the software development process, which can be to acquire artifacts, automate deployment, run unit tests, create tasks, run custom workflows or scripts, etc. The task definitions for the SmartCMP pipeline include: Custom task types: Jenkins Job tasks, new application deployment tasks, cloud resource change tasks, application update tasks, script execution tasks, and other custom tasks; The publisher of the pipeline can define the input and output parameters for each task and make calls in subsequent tasks. For example, through a blueprint deployment task, it supports deploying any new application to various rich environments such as Windows, Linux, and K8s containers, that is, it can automatically trigger a published cloud resource service to deploy cloud resources. Tasks can automate cloud resource changes and operations, and upgrade and update application software. Relying on the standard operation module and the underlying capabilities of the SmartCMP platform, you can design a variety of complex operation scenarios to meet the needs of large-scale deployment and massive operations Execution History Through the execution history, you can view the execution status, executor, execution time, and detailed information of each stage task execution. The following figure shows the execution of a complex pipeline: Artifact Management Artifacts, often referred to as binary software artifacts, are the output of the build process, including software packages, test reports, application configuration files, etc. which can be run directly or can be viewed in binary form on the server. Artifact management is the management of the artifacts generated during the software development process and is generally released and delivered as the final deliverable. All artifact packages and dependent components can be integrated into the product library for unified management. The product library should be the only source of trusted artifacts for testing and production deployment. Different production languages produce different ways of acquiring, using, and sharing artifacts. Different product libraries can manage binary artifacts of their respective language types. SmartCMP embeds the leading binary artifact management repository Nexus into the code stream. Development organizations typically build artifact management systems for each project to make it easier and more convenient to acquire artifacts and to achieve good performance for transferring large artifacts over the network. Although developers use different types of code to develop build tools and testers use different types of test tools, software artifact management systems specify warehouse types and artifact locations and handle all the complexities of getting the latest and correct artifacts, reduce the complexity of the creation of automated pipeline releases and quickly get the right artifacts to improve deployment efficiency. Endpoint Endpoint can add software artifact repositories that need to be connected, provide the source of the artifacts at deployment time for the software components to be used, and define the docking of software packages or task schedules. A copy of the package that performs archiving or mirroring push operations in the pipeline will be stored at the product library. Connection with Nexus, Jenkins and other management platforms to the endpoint is supported. Copyright © 2016-2020 CloudChef. All Rights Reserved.

Cloud resource blueprint service scenario The Cloud Resource Blueprint Service is based on blueprint modeling to define standard service frameworks and components, providing a rich set of out-of-the-box software components to visualize blueprints for automated deployment. For example, configuring a vSphere single-node virtual machine service is a typical scenario for a cloud resource blueprint service. After the blueprint is modeled by the administrator, the service configuration can specify the resources and parameters that the user can apply for, and form a standard service based on the blueprint. After the release, the user can apply for self-service and automate the delivery. Ticket service scenario There are two types of ticket services: Apply for non-standardized resources (for example, apply for a cloud resource blueprint service to uninstall a service deployment. This action is a typical service scenario for ticket services) Services that require IT manual intervention (for example, manual ticket service for resetting passwords. This action is also a typical service scenario for ticket services) 「Note」Please refer to Quick Configuration of Cloud Resource Blueprint Services for more cloud resource blueprint services. For detailed ticket service please go to Request service Management When using the system release service for the first time, you need to do the following to configure the system: Configure the cloud platform portal: administrator login information such as vSphere and OpenStack. Add IP Pool: Define the range of available IP addresses Define resource bundles: configure available physical resources and set quotas, such as CPU, memory, storage, network, etc. Define business groups, associated personnel, resource bundles, configuration approval process, deployment specifications, etc. Define virtual machine templates: Select the cloud platform and the corresponding template or image Define blueprints: define the architecture of the service and automate the installation logic Configure and publish the service: associate the blueprint to the service group and resource bundle, and configure the deployment parameters, such as selecting a VM template. Request service: Apply for service in the service catalog. You can also enable the guided application function of the business group in the \"Organization\" - \"Business Groups\" Self-service operation: View detailed information about service deployment, instances or cloud resources in Deployment menu, and perform self-service operation. The next chapter will explain how the administrator configures the first cloud resource, publishes and requests the service. Log in Enter SmartCMP IP in browser, such as: http：//SmartCMP-Public-IP/#/login Enter username & password. Configure cloud platform portal The cloud platform portal defines the cloud infrastructure resources of the public cloud, private cloud, container, or physical machine that SmartCMP manages. Different cloud infrastructure account has different forms and acquisition methods. The administrator can complete the registration of the cloud platform infrastructure by filling in the corresponding infrastructure access information. 「Note」Please use the tenant administrator or infrastructure administrator to log in to the SmartCMP platform.

Click “Save” and the IP pool is created successfully. 「Note」The start IP should be greater than the CIDR range, and the end IP should be greater than the start IP. Define Resource bundles SmartCMP can map resources in a cloud platform to multiple logical units by defining resource bundles, and configure them to different organizational structures, thereby designating different organizations and users to use the infrastructure resources in the cloud platform, including computing, storage and network resources, etc. A cloud platform can define a resource bundle or multiple resource bundles. Define the relationship between the resource bundle and the service group. There are three types of resource sharing: The resource bundle is only assigned to a unique service group. Operation method: Do not select \"Allow sharing to multiple business groups\", click \"Business Group\" to select the business group. The resource bundle is assigned to all service groups, and the newly added service group is automatically associated with the resource bundle. To do this, select “Allow sharing to multiple service groups” and click “Business Group” to select all service groups Resource bundles are shared to multiple service groups. Operation method: Select “Allow sharing to multiple service groups”. Click “Business Group” to selects multiple service groups. The steps to create a resource bundle are as follows: 「Note」Please use the tenant administrator or infrastructure administrator to log in to the SmartCMP platform. Adding vSphere Resource Go to “Infrastructure” - “Resource bundles, click “Add”, select vSphere, fill in the following information: Basic Information page: • Basic information: name, resource tag (optional), priority (the smaller the value, the higher the priority), • Cloud platform resource information: Select cloud platform portal (select the newly created vSphere cloud platform), resource portal, folder (optional) ③ After the “Basic Information” page loads successfully, click “Compute Resource”: Resource entry information: view only Physical host information: view only Compute resources: number of vCPUs (upper limit), memory (upper limit), number of virtual machines (upper limit), number of snapshots allowed per virtual machine (upper limit) Storage: Select storage and its reserved space Network Resources: Network resources: Select a network, select the IP pool in IP allocation method, and select the newly created IP pool under the “IPAM”.

In this way, you can access resources on demand and open and release resources at any time without having to purchase large amounts of resources in advance. Network Resources Security Policy Group: Select one or more security policy groups Virtual Switch: If you choose a private network, you can choose a virtual switch. Click “Save” and the Aliyun resource bundle is created successfully. Define Business Group A business group is a logical organization structure within a tenant. SmartCMP supports the creation of a multi-level business group for the organization structure of the enterprise within the system. The business group associates the user to which the business group belongs and the resource bundles that the business group can use. A business group is a logical concept. Entities that need to associate users, service catalogs, and resource quotas can be associated with business groups, such as subsidiaries, departments at different levels, and so on. Default business group and tenant administrator, business group administrator, and business group members are created by default. Resource bundles can be assigned by the following steps: 「Note」If you need to modify the settings of this business group or create a new business group, please refer to the detailed steps in Organization Click “Organization” - “Business Groups” and click the business group name (Default) to enter the editing page Overview page, keep the default value User page: keep the default value. By default, two users are set up as business group administrators and business group member. Resource Bundles: click Add, select the vSphere resource bundle and OpenStack resource bundle created in the previous section, and click OK. Click Save to associate the business group with the resource bundle. Apply for resource and service association approval process for the business group, set naming rules and request specification. Configure cloud resource operations entitlement and service deployment operations entitlement for business group members Configure resources and budget quotas for business group members Define Virtual Machine Template The platform supports the creation of virtual machine templates. One operating system can correspond to multiple virtual machine templates, and one virtual machine template can be used in multiple cloud platforms. The virtual machine template is associated with a template in the vSphere platform or an image in the OpenStack platform. The installation mode and account information of the two SmartCMP agents can be configured in the VM template. The two agents are monitoring agents and automation agents. Some automation features in the SmartCMP platform rely on automated agents. For example: blueprint with application deployment or disk addition, service configuration initialization with disk mounted and new users created and some virtual machine operations (including reset password, execute script, application start & stop, add and extend Linux logical volume or Windows Disk, etc.). Once a virtual machine template is created, it can be specified directly in the service configuration. SmartCMP automatically recognizes virtual machine templates based on the cloud platform on which the blueprint objects are located. Here defines two virtual machine templates: CentOS 7 and Windows 2012 R2. 「Note」Please use the tenant administrator or infrastructure administrator to log in to SmartCMP. Tenant administrators can assign an infrastructure administrator role to a user. By default, three virtual machine templates are created: Windows 2012 R2, Redhat 7, and CentOS 7. You need to add the corresponding cloud platform information to use. Add a Linux VM Template Add a Linux VM Template Select Infrastructure - VM Templates to enter the VM template list interface. This page has 2 Linux virtual machine templates by default, Redhat 7 and CentOS 7 respectively.

The underlying infrastructure and network environment of the enterprise are more complex and the distributed architecture adopted by SmartCMP can adapt to various scenarios, such as: multiple data centers; multiple VPCs, isolation of virtual network environment; hybrid cloud, including private cloud (data center) + public cloud. By opening a limited communication port between CloudGateway and the master node, SmartCMP can use the cloud platform gateway to manage and monitor the resources of each VPC, data center or remote site in a unified manner. Typical application scenario of the cloud platform gateway is the network isolation problem when the gateway cannot support the complete SaaS mode, which leads to the disconnection of SmartCMP and the isolated data center network. For example, as shown in the following figure: SmartCMP is connected to the main data center network but not connected to the isolated center network. We need to use the network segment of the main data center to access the isolated data center. By installing a virtual machine with Gateway in the main data center, after the Gateway is successfully deployed, add proxy gateway to center's cloud platform to connect SmartCMP to the isolated data center. The specific implementation steps are described below: First of all, SmartCMP has built-in CloudGateway component in the component library. This component provides Nginx, Consul, Prometheus and other functions. Each Gateway component can only reverse the address of one cloud platform and monitor the API port of the cloud platform. Blueprint designer can organize CloudGateway, virtual machine, and network in the blueprint visual editor, as shown in the following figure: two network components, one of which is the management network to ensure the connection between Gateway and CMP, and the other is a proxy network to ensure the connection between Gateway and data center. In the service configuration, set the relevant parameters of the cloud platform gateway, including: the download path (the download path of the Ansible installation package of CloudGateway), the gateway (the gateway of the network that SmartCMP and main data center can connect), the proxy network segment (the network segments that SmartCMP and main data center can connect) and other information. After the installation is successful, the component will appear in the list of cloud resource software, and the cloud gateway menu has also been added, which is placed in Infrastructure - Cloud Gateways. It is necessary to associate the cloud gateway with the data center cloud platform of the isolated network to open the link between SmartCMP and the isolated data center. Also, in the service deployment, users can view the cloud gateway information that has been successfully deployed, and perform operations such as refreshing the status, stopping, installing software, and deleting.

The administrator allocates the resource bundle to the business group to implement the segmentation of the cloud platform resources. You can specify the resource bundle to use the specific resources of the target cloud platform. For example, you can customize the resource bundle to associate the storage resource and network resource with the development resource bundle. Through the resource bundle, specify the resource quotas that can be used, such as the total number of virtual machines allowed to be deployed, the total amount of vCPUs allowed, the total amount of memory, and so on. Add a Resource Bundle After the cloud platform is successfully added, the cloud platform resources are divided into one or more resource bundles, and the corresponding resource quotas are allocated to different business groups. The relationship between resource bundles and business groups is divided into three types: Resource bundle is only assigned to a unique business group Resource bundle is assigned to all business groups, and the newly added business group automatically associates the resource bundle Resource bundles are shared to multiple business groups Support resource bundle replication. Usage scenarios: When an administrator configures multiple clusters for vCenter, each business group needs to configure these clusters as resource bundles, allowing administrators to quickly create resource bundles with the same or similar configuration. Specific operation steps: In the left navigation, select \"Infrastructure\" and select \"Resource Bundle Management\". In the list of resource bundles, select a resource bundle and click the copy button (When multiple resource bundles are selected, the copy button will not work.) to generate a new resource bundle creation page. The name of the copied resource is automatically changed to \" -1\" (for example, the original resource bundle name is vSphereDemo, and the copied one is vSphereDemo-1). All configurations are the same as the original resource bundle. The administrator can modify the related parameters of the original resource bundle, including the assigned business group and the sharing mode. Support resource bundle enable or disable. When the administrator is creating and editing a resource bundle, a selection button is added below the priority to enable the resource bundle, which is selected by default. Resource bundles, whether enabled or disabled, can be assigned to business groups. After disabling, when deploying cloud resources, the selection of this resource bundle is not supported, but the existing resources are not affected in any way. Add a vSphere Resource Bundle You can add a vSphere resource bundle by following the steps below: In the left navigation, select “Infrastructure” and select the secondary menu “Resource Bundles”.

Specific steps for adding tags: Click \"Infrastructure\"-\"Resource tags\", the administrator has the authority to configure tags and define the parameters of the tags. Configure the \"Basic Information\" of the resource tag: name (generally configured in Chinese, such as 环境), primary key (only letters and numbers, such as env, as the identification bit), description, order (defines the order of tag selection) , selection type ( Single-selection / multiple-selection, specify how tags select value sets when performing filtering), specified resource types: cloud resources (for example: resource pool), storage resources (for example: vSphere data storage, OpenStack storage type), network resources. Note: You can set multiple tags for the same resource pool. For example, you can choose different tags for storage or network resources in the same vSphere resource pool. Configure the \"value set\" of the resource tag. For example, when the key is an environment and supports creation of a value, it supports adding a value set (for example, production environment), and it also supports adding multiple value sets (for example, production environment, test environment and development environment) and each value needs to be configured with a name, a primary key (which can be used for naming rules), and a description. Click the Save button and the resource tag is created. Using Resource Tags After the resource label is created, bind the resource pool to the resource label. Specific operation steps: Click \"Infrastructure\"-\"Resource pool management\" on the left navigation bar and select \"Key Value\" in the resource label. A resource pool can only select one key but one or more values. for example: vSphere resource pool, key is selected as \"environment\", select a value \"development environment\" or multiple values \"production environment, test environment, development environment\". Scenarios of resource tags in service configuration: Configure the resource pool of Server or Instance node. The available resource pools are derived from the \"shared resource pool or the resource pool bound to the business group\". The role of the resource tag in selecting the resource pool: Select a strategy for manually specifying a resource pool, and then filter based on the selected resource tags, and then select based on the results of the tag filtering and choose whether to allow modification during request or approval. For example: configuration of vSphere Cloud Service Server component. Select the strategy for manually specifying the resource pool, select the resource pool \"vSphere Development \" with the \"Development Environment\" resource tag, and check \"Allow modification\" and \"Change only during approval\". After the service configuration is completed, when the service is applied, the resource pool can be selected again. Select the resource pool selection policy of \"Automatically select the one with largest remaining capacity, lowest cost or evenly allocate\". The platform will automatically allocate according to the policy, and when it is automatically allocated, you can only choose among the resource pools filtered by tags. For more service configuration information, please refer to: Service Configuration Scenarios of resource tags in service requests: Configure resource pools in the service configuration to allow modification. On the application page, for each key, according to the resource tags configured in the resource pool, only the values already used in the resource pool are displayed. 「Note」In the scenario of \"multiple keys and each key has multiple values\". For example, there are two keys, \"Environment, Performance\". When the key is the environment, there are three values below, which are \"Pro, UAT, Dev\"; when the key is performance, the three values below are \"high performance, medium performance, and general performance\". There are two resource pools (vSphere-dev resource pool and vSphere-test resource pool). The vSphere-dev resource pool has 2 tags Pro and high performance, and the vSphere-test resource pool has 2 tags UAT and general performance. When configuring the display of cloud resources and service request pages, only Pro and UAT are displayed under \"Environment\", and only high performance and general performance are displayed under \"Performance\". After selecting one of the resource tag values arbitrarily, the remaining tag display must be dynamically adjusted based on the selection of the value of the first resource tag. For example: first select the value “Pro” of the resource label, and the remaining second label will only show “high performance”. By analogy, in application scenarios with more keys and more values, the selection logic is also consistent. Copyright © 2016-2020 CloudChef. All Rights Reserved.

SmartCMP supports the creation of a multi-level business group for the organization structure of the enterprise within the system. The business group associates the user to which the business group belongs and the resource bundles that the business group can use. A business group is a logical concept. Entities that need to associate users, service catalogs, and resource quotas can be associated with business groups, such as subsidiaries, departments at different levels, and so on. Default business group and tenant administrator, business group administrator, and business group members are created by default. A business group can create one or more projects.

Click the drop-down list to select the added entitlement profiles. Leave blank to use the default template in the system settings. Once configured, the default template configuration will be overwritten. Resource Quota Business group resource quota meets the needs of controlling department-level resource quotas. The budget quota of the business group is independent of the resource quota of the resource bundle. When the budget of the business group reaches the threshold and there is a large amount of resource quota remaining in the resource bundle, business group members cannot request new resources in the service catalog. Note: The resource quota can be configured with a larger amount than the business group budget. Specifically, the following resources can be set: CPU, memory, storage, and number of virtual machines. Note: First, you must enable \"Enable resource quota\". Disabled by default: The resource quota interface prohibits input and does not calculate the amount of resources used Enabled: The above resources can set quotas. They are all non-required items. Only integers greater than or equal to zero can be entered. Leave blank to indicate no limit. Supports viewing of used quotas. (If a certain quota is unlimited, then the remaining is always unlimited. The usage rate is always 0%.) When new service deployment occupies resources, operations modify the configuration, or the resource usage or the business group gets changed, the corresponding resource usage will change. 「Note」If the business group has not enabled quotas, but the business group has resources occupied, after the quota is enabled, the business group needs to be able to display the resources that have been used. Quotas for child business groups are temporarily independent, that is, they are not restricted by the parent business group and can be configured separately. Budget Quota The administrator can configure a monthly budget for this business group, leaving it blank for unlimited. 「Note」Personal budget cannot be greater than the total budget of the business group. When the spending of this month exceeds the budget, users will not be able to request new cloud resources, and paid instances belonging to users will be shut down. Supports control of resources and resource requests based on configured policies. You can view the real-time usage rate, resource usage, and remaining amount of cloud resources of the business group on this page. Specific steps: Select year or month as the time unit. Select monthly to indicate that it is cleared on the 1st of each month and restore the initial value; select annual to indicate that the zero has been cleared on the beginning of the next year and restore the initial value. Business group quota management: Fill in the total budget. Set the percentage. When the overall cost of the business group exceeds the configured total budget percentage, subsequent notifications are triggered, and the system will automatically send a notification to the business group administrator. User quota management: Set personal budget and percentage. When personal budget usage reaches the threshold, trigger subsequent notifications and send notifications to users. Budget strategy: Select \"Cannot request new resources after the budget is used up\". When the business group budget is used up, all users associated with the business group will not be able to request new resources that require payment. Select \"Paid resources will be automatically shut down after the budget is used up\". For example: Configure vSphere billing rules. Deploy vSphere instances. Configure business group billing and personal budgets. Configure \"Shutdown after budgets are used up\", and when personal budgets are used up, the instances belonging to the individual will be shut down, or when the business group budget is used up, those belonging to the business group will be shut down. After shutdown, reservation will be made according to the retention time of the business group and after the retention time expires, the resources will be put into the recycle bin. 「Note」When there are multiple users with different quotas in the business group, one user owing money does not affect other users' requests for resources. The instances belonging to that user are shut down which does not affect the status of other users'. Personal budget renewal: Submit the renewal ticket.

You can connect to any organizational structure of any company through the cascaded business group. The cascaded business group has the following characteristics: The users associated with the child business group do not necessarily have to be associated with the parent business group. The tenant administrator may check \"When you add a user to a child business group, add this user to the parent business group as well.\" in \"System\"-\"Business Groups\", that is: when you add users into the child business group, the user will be automatically added to the parent business group Uncheck this option, when the user does not exist in the parent business group, the child business group can also directly add the associated user, and it will not be automatically added to the parent business group The parent business group administrator will automatically become the administrator of all child business groups (this rule has nothing to do with system configuration) The resource bundles associated with each level of business group are independent of each other The service catalogs associated with each level of business group are independent of each other The deployment and virtual machines associated with each level of the business group are independent of each other Delete a Business Group You can delete a business group by following the steps below: On the left navigation, select “Organization Structure” - “Business Group”, select a business group, and click the “Delete” button.

Entitlement profiles: define operation permission for service deployment and cloud resources; Naming policies: define naming rules for instances and cloud resources. The advantages of configuration templates: optimized the configuration of entitlements. The original deployment and cloud resource entitlements need to be configured on the business group and service configuration. After configuring the template, one-time configuration can be repeatedly applied to different business groups. In the system configuration, two default templates can be selected for the business group configuration: the business group default entitlement profile and the business group default naming policy. After configuration, all business groups use such templates by default. Entitlement Profiles Users can create and manage entitlement profiles on the entitlement profile page, define the operations users can perform on service deployments and cloud resources, and specify the approval process. Entitlement profiles can be applied to different business groups. The deployment's entitlement stipulates the operations that can be performed after the service is successfully deployed and the approval process for the operation. Go to the \"Deployment\"-\"Instances\" page, enter the instance details page, and perform corresponding operations on the virtual machine. Cloud resource entitlement stipulates the operations that can be performed on the cloud resource and the approval process for the operation. In the \"Deployment\"-\"My Deployments\" page, select a service deployment and the top of the list page will display the operations that can be performed by the service deployment. There are two methods for setting cloud resource entitlement. The first is to set in the entitlement profile; the second is to set in the service configuration. The cloud resource entitlement in the service configuration will inherit the business group configuration, and the enabling and disabling functions and approval process can be changed within this range. Operations that are not enabled in the business group cannot be enabled at the service configuration. The following describes the method of adding cloud resource entitlement at the business group level. Add Entitlement Profiles Users can add entitlement profiles according to the following steps: Select \"Organization\"-\"Entitlement Profiles\" in the left navigation bar, and click \"Add\". On the \"Overview\" tab, fill in the name and description and check whether to allow sharing. On the \"Deployment's entitlement\" tab, click \"Add\", fill in the operation name and role, and select the enabled / disabled status of the operation authorization and the enabled approval process (optional). Check an operation in the \"Operation\" list, such as changing the owner, starting service deployment, stopping service deployment, etc. In the \"Roles\" list, select the role that can perform this operation. In \"Status\", you can check enable (can perform this virtual machine operation) or disable (cannot perform this virtual machine operation). In \"Approval process\", user can choose the default template (business group administrator approval process or tenant administrator approval process). On the \"Cloud Resource's entitlement\" tab, click \"Add\" and select the cloud platform type, component, operation, role, enable / disable status of the operation authorization, and enabled approval process (optional) through the drop-down list. Check an operation in the \"Operation\" list, such as enable, stop, suspend, etc. Select the role that can perform this operation in \"Role\", and check Enable (can perform the virtual machine operation) or Disable (cannot perform the virtual machine operation) in \"Status\". In \"Approval process\", user can choose the default template (business group administrator approval process or tenant administrator approval process). You can modify or delete each added configuration, or continue to add new entitlement. Click \"Save\" and return to the entitlement profiles page.

SmartCMP provides a rich set of out-of-the-box software components that visualize blueprints, provide custom forms, and define parameters and fields for any service. Flexible configuration of resources for each service meets the diverse needs of users. At the same time SmartCMP provides a built-in process designer, allowing users to design service processes and approval processes in a visually drag-and-drop manner, helping users to complete process strategy design accurately and quickly. The administrator groups the services through the service catalog to publish the IT products and services required by the enterprise or organization and provides the users with self-service requests. Service modeling configures resources, parameters, automated workflows, and approval policies for each service for automated deployment. The following diagram describes the whole process of how to assemble components, build blueprints, configure service, group service, and publish. Software architects combine software components and infrastructure components to build a blueprint for cloud services. Administrators configure resources and parameters for services. IT support administrators define processes and specify service teams to group and publish services to service catalogs.

It not only has rich component resources and common operations built in, but also has a highly scalable capability. It can flexibly customize component resources and configure operations. The definition of components adopts an object-oriented design method, uses a unified data structure for modeling, and standardizes configuration properties. Software architects can also create reusable software components as needed and use operation scripts to accurately specify the deployment operation process. Platform supports rewriting these operation scripts at any time, releases them in real time, and synchronously updates installed software components. By defining attributes and passing attributes as parameters to action scripts, software components can be deployed in different environments without modifying the script. Support to use Ansible, Terraform, Shell, Python, Json, Ruby and other languages to customize software components, and customize the life cycle operations of software components (including creation, configuration, start, stop, delete, backup, inspection, etc.). System has built-in create, configure and start operations, call stop and delete operations when removed, and support flexible custom operations to achieve full lifecycle management of software and applications. Components in SmartCMP consist of attributes and interfaces. Software components are composed of scripts, attributes, metadata, and lifecycle management. Flexible software components can be associated with mainstream product libraries. The specific concepts are as follows: Script: Each phase of the lifecycle is controlled by scripts. Thanks to the powerful underlying class library, SmartCMP supports languages such as Shell, Powershell, Ruby, Python, etc., which can quickly integrate application deployment into the cloud management platform. Attributes: Different application systems have custom requirements for resource requirements and capacity control. Attribute items can pass custom parameters according to different system deployment requirements. The software architect can expose the configuration parameters that the application component needs to fill out to the request interface by setting the custom attribute. The SmartCMP cloud management platform will automatically invoke the relevant parameters to execute the installation configuration of the application Metadata: Metadata contains properties of the application component itself, including application component versions, related descriptions, regular inheritance relationships, and dependent system types Lifecycle Management: SmartCMP cloud management platform provides complete lifecycle management of creation, configuration, start, stop, and removal of applications. All software configuration from deployment to expiration uninstallation is done through script correspondence Software components are associated with the mainstream product library, supporting the docking of Jfrog Artifactory, the Nexus product library, and implementing software version updates. Software architects can manage components through the component management interface. In the navigation on the left, choose Service Design - SW Components. A list of all components appears in the right navigation area. Rich Component Library Out-of-the-box component resources. SmartCMP cloud management platform has a large number of commonly-used component resources, including IaaS (cloud hosts, networks, storage, etc. for different cloud platforms), PaaS (servers, databases, RDS, etc.), containers (Kubernetes , Docker), software (MySQL, Oracle, Nginx, etc.), agents (monitoring agents, automation agents). Different types of resources are created and managed in a unified interface, using a tree-like grouping catalog, supporting custom component grouping, secondary editing, quick copy, importing, and exporting components. Tree Grouping Catalog Supports a grouped catalog of components and a tree structure. You can search for tree displays in creating components page and component lists. The tree structure on the component list page can be added, deleted, and modified. Existing component catalogs cannot be deleted. The tree structure is a logical folder concept and has no binding relationship with the resource type of the component. The tree structure allows users to adjust. For example, some users have a cloud platform at the first level, and computing, storage, and network components under the cloud platform at the second level; and some users have computing, network, and storage at the first level, and each has a second level. cloud platform. Details: IaaS is used to describe all IaaS components. Each component has its own cloud platform type. The secondary nodes under IaaS mainly include computing, network, storage, object storage, load balancing, security group, file system, etc. The following subdirectories are added by default. Cloud hostStorageOSS: Object storageDisk: Block storageNAS Network: NetworkSubnet: SubnetRouter: Routing SecurityGroup: Security groupFirewallLoad balancingLoad balancing listenerFloating IPDomain nameGateway PaaS is used to describe all PaaS components. Each component has its own cloud platform type. The secondary nodes under PaaS mainly include the service capabilities provided by the cloud platform. By default, the following subdirectories are added. WebAPPMQCache: cacheRDSNoSQLBigData : Big Data Services Container is used to describe all the components of the container platform.DockerKubernetes Software component is used to describe all software components. Each component has its own cloud platform type. The software is divided into two types, one is binary installed software that runs inside the machine, and the other is container image software running in the container. The container image component can be distinguished by type, and an attribute resource.software is added to mark whether the software is running in the machine or the container. The following subdirectories are added by default: WebAPPMQCache: CacheRDSNoSQLBigData: Big Data Service Agent, which means all agent components, including automation components, monitoring components, etc., for subsequent agent management. Monitoring agents and automation agents 「Note」 Monitoring component: If you need to use cloud platform monitoring to view cloud server indicator data and generate alerts, you need to properly install the monitoring component on the cloud server. Cloud server indicator data collection depends on the monitoring component. Edit component Select a component in the component list to enter the edit component view. Editing a component is similar to creating a component. In order to ensure that the blueprints created using this component will not be unusable due to component updates, during editing, there are some items in each sub view of the component that are not allowed to change. Click the \"Back\" button at any time during the process of editing the component to abandon editing the component. Import and export components You can import components according to the following steps: Select \"Service Design\"-\"Component Library\" Click the \"Import\" Click \"Browse\", select the local component (ZIP format), and click \"Submit\" The component is imported successfully You can export components according to the following steps: Select \"Service Design\"-\"Component Library\" Select a component in the component list, the \"Export\" button on the menu bar will become available, click \"Export\" The component is exported successfully Copy / delete components You can follow these steps to copy components: Select \"Service Design\"-\"Component Library\" Select a component in the component list, the \"Copy\" button on the menu bar will become available, click \"Copy\" Enter the editing page of the replication component to change the basic information, attributes, script list, and node interface information. The component name needs to be modified as the component does not allow duplicate names You can remove components according to the following steps: In the component list view, select the component to be deleted After clicking the \"Delete\" button in the list toolbar, confirm in the confirmation dialog box and the component will be deleted Create Components Users can create reusable components according to their needs, componentize any resource, and standardize the process of configuring components, including defining resource types, versions, attributes, component operations, etc., and all configuration interfaces are open to user customization. For example, when a DBA creates a database cluster and an Oracle database needs to be deployed, DBA can add Oracle components to the component library and configure components according to requirements, including configuring component profiles, instructions, properties, scripts, and operations (create, start, stop, restart, delete, etc. the specified database) Support software architects to customize software components. Specific steps for adding components: Click the \"Add\" button to enter the create component view. The create component view contains \"Basic Information\", \"Attributes\", \"Script List\", \"Operations\", \"History Version\", and \"Artifacts\". Component Overview In the \"Basic Information\" view, define the component name, description, component version, component type (define the resource type of the component and determine the properties and operations of the component. For example, when you select the component type as Software when adding an Oracle component, the newly created Oracle component will be Inherit the properties and operations of the software component of the parent class. You can also customize the properties to obtain different functions from the parent class.), cloud platform information and upload icon. You can also add a description of the component. After selecting Artifact, you can select the binary software artifact library on the \" Artifacts\" tab to configure the software version. For specific steps, refer to associating mainstream artifact libraries. Check Instantiate. After checking, the component can be arranged by Blueprint Design. In the left navigation, select \"Service Design\"-\"Blueprint Design\", and a list of all components appears in the right navigation area. Component Attributes Attributes: It is used to meet the specific requirements of resource deployment and parameter control of different systems. It is composed of primary key, type, default value, alternatives and description. You can add optional values to the alternatives, so that when you apply for service, you can only choose from the values defined in the default and alternatives. You can create software attributes that require the use of characters, floating point numbers, passwords, Booleans, or integer values. Support for setting validation rules. Enter regular expressions and the attribute parameter must pass the validation of the expression. (Example: Integer type: Use integer attribute types for zero and positive or negative integers. Boolean type: Use Boolean attribute types to provide True and False options in the Value drop-down menu.) In the Properties view, add the properties of the component. After the addition is complete, you can pass them as parameters to the operation script. For example, when the component Oracle is created, different application systems have specific requirements and custom requirements for Oracle's deployment requirements and parameter control. \"Attributes\" can be set according to the deployment requirements of different systems, by setting custom attributes, exposing configuration parameters that application components need to fill out to the interface configuration, and passing custom parameters. When Oracle is deployed automatically, the SmartCMP cloud management platform automatically invokes relevant parameters to perform application installation and configuration, which meets different requirements for Oracle deployment in different data clusters. Script List Scripts: Each stage of the component life cycle is controlled by scripts. Thanks to the powerful underlying class libraries, it supports customizable scripts including Ansible, Terraform, Shell, Python and other methods. In the \"Script \" view, you can add a script file by creating a new file. These script files should be associated with an operation in the component interface or referenced by other script files. At the same time, you can add text files, which are typically used to provide configuration information for the component. Multiple clicks to create a new file can add multiple files. After entering the file name and file type, click Action-Edit Content. You can write the file content on the right. Actions Action: You can perform complete life cycle management on the application system creation, configuration, start, stop, and delete processes. Through script correspondence, complete all software configuration work from installation and deployment to uninstallation after expiration. In the \"Action\" view, you can associate the script file added in the \"Script List\" view to the corresponding operation of the component, which is implemented under each operation action-please select the script file corresponding to this operation from the drop-down list. Built-in actions include configuration, creation, delete, start, stop, and more. Take the refresh operation as an example, the operation is configured in system in advance, and the implementation methods, scripts, tasks, and parameters necessary for the operation are used. The built-in operation can be applied to any resource on the platform. Therefore, when the component Oracle is created, the built-in \"start, stop, restart, delete, refresh\" operations are automatically inherited. Encapsulation hides the implementation details of complex operations and only provides public access to the outside world. The platform has complex operations built-in and works out of the box, reducing differences and difficulty in understanding. For example: \"adjust virtual machine configuration\" operation (adjust virtual machine calculation specifications and cloud platform specifications), when the cloud platform type is different, the SmartCMP cloud management platform hides the details of the flow of resource operations, only exposing public access interfaces. For example, the \"Adjust virtual machine configuration\" operation is applied to a virtual machine on the Hyper-V platform and a virtual machine on the OpenStack platform. The specific technical implementation is different, but the user configuration interface displays the same content. At the same time, you can also add more component actions here and associate the corresponding script files. Click the Add button. After all required fields are added, click the Save button to generate a new component. You can see the newly added component on the component list. Click the \"Back\" button at any time during the process of adding components to discard adding components. Life cycle action Description Example Create Create Software Create a Tomcat service, and scripts written for the Create lifecycle operation will run when the software is first installed. Configuration Configurate software Configure Tomcat and set JAVA_OPTS and CATALINA_OPTS. The configuration script runs after the installation operation is complete. Start Start software Use the startup command in the Tomcat server to start the Tomcat service. The startup script runs after the configuration operation is complete. Stop Stop software Use the stop command in the Tomcat server to stop the Tomcat service. The stop script runs after the start operation is complete. Delete Delete software Perform specific actions in the application before destroying the deployment. The delete script runs after the software component is destroyed. Configuration Action While a large number of common actions are built in, system supports the operation of custom components, and the configuration interface is open to users, including the implementation of custom actions (supporting scripts / tasks); scripts (scripts come from custom script files); filter conditions, the components action supports the filter condition of EL expression. When the expression is customized, the action can be displayed in the action list only when the filter condition is satisfied. After the display becomes effective, it can be selected for execution. Otherwise, the action will not be displayed in the action list. The format of the expression, for example: $ {param}, $ {param> 1}, $ {param == 'abc'}, $ {param! = Null}, $ {param == null}, when you fill in the expression $ {componentType! = 'resource.iaas.instance.vSphere'} indicating that the component type needs to be a virtual machine of the vSphere cloud platform, and the customized action can take effect on the component resources that \"fulfill the above conditions\", that is, it will be displayed in the \" vSphere cloud platform virtual machine action list \"and support the corresponding operations. Action grouping (actions are grouped, for example: start, stop, suspend, restart, etc. under common actions; change setting labels, adjust virtual machine configuration, update cloud host name, etc. under configuration actions) And the specific parameter configuration (timeout time and maximum number of retries) performed. For example: add a backup operation to the IaaS cloud host resource (the Linux virtual machine of the vSphere cloud platform). Customize the basic information of the operation. Customize the \"backup script backup.sh\" in the script list. When configuring the operation, select the script backup.sh, bind the script to the operation, and select the operation mode as \"Shell\". 「Note」The Linux virtual machine of the vSphere cloud platform. The added operations are supported on the \"Deployments\"-\"Instance\" page. For details, please refer to: Cloud Resource Operation Entitlement Software component form configuration: In the software component, parameters and forms can be configured for the \"create\" action and other custom actions, where the form is dynamically generated based on attributes. The content of the completed form is configured (supports JSON format), and the preview of the form can also be displayed directly to meet various needs. Support for secondary update operation. The system has provided the implementation of this operation. If you need to override, you can enable the option \"Override system action\". In the \"Action\" view, click any action to enter the basic information tab page. When the selected primary key name matches the existing built-in action of the system, the option and prompt to overwrite the operating system will appear. Select \"Overwrite system action\" and later information such as implementation configuration, execution configuration, and form configuration will appear. Dependencies Some component resources cannot be deployed separately. For example, software components need to be deployed in conjunction with other component resources to support the creation and management of dependencies between the current component and other components. Dependencies are used to define the different sequence of multiple components in the scenario of simultaneous orchestration and deployment, and runtime parameters can be passed between components that have dependencies. In the \"Dependencies\" view: Select the type (included / dependent), and then select the target component. For example, in the vSphere cloud platform, the MySQL component and Serve component are included, and the Serve component and Network component are dependent. Version Management When you update the component, each updated version will be recorded and supported to fall back to the historical version. The specific steps are as follows: Click the \"Any component\" button on the toolbar of the component list to enter the software component view In the “History Version” view, you can see all the historical versions. When you make changes, the platform will record your historical version information by default: version number, version description, creator and creation time. You can check the corresponding version v1, click “Restore Version” to return from the version v2 to the historical version v1, and click “Save and Synchronize” to synchronize the component information. At the same time, it also supports one-click to delete any historical version, check the version to be deleted, click “Delete” to confirm the deletion and delete successfully. Associate Mainstream Product Libraries Support software components’ association with mainstream product libraries, docking Jfrog Artifactory, Nexus product library matching package management platform and software version update. The version of the package management tool supports the latest tag, indicating that the latest version is used. In the Products view, you can select endpoints, warehouses (Jfrog Artifactory, Nexus), groups, names, versions Click the Save button to associate the component with the package management platform.

The system provides standard workflows by default and supports administrators to define the processes required for flexible services through the workflow designer, control cloud application, operations, and recycle, and manage and close manual ticket services. There are three main types of workflows for the platform: approval, manual ticket service, and cloud resource blueprint service process. Approval Workflow Management Support tenant administrators to customize the approval workflow template through the workflow designer. The specific configuration of the customization includes the approval hierarchy, the approval of the approver, the approval rules, and the operations that can be performed. Main function point: Support for defining any multi-level approvals. Support the entire workflow of graphical design approval in Workflow Designer. Support for defining approval by user or role. Support for defining the configuration of the request when defining an approval. Support for defining requirements for approval and notification at the business group and service catalog level. Support for approver batch operation approval. Support for setting fields that can be modified by each level of approver. There are two ways to configure the SmartCMP configuration workflow: First, the business group administrator or tenant administrator adds the approval workflow A to the business group configuration. Second, the business group administrator or tenant administrator adds the approval workflow B to the service configuration. When the two configuration methods are used at the same time, the approval workflow conflicts. The approval workflow B in the service configuration takes precedence over the approval workflow A in the business group configuration. Add an approval workflow to a business group You can add an approval workflow to a business group. After the configuration is successful, when a business group member applies for service deployment, it needs to be controlled through the workflow in the approval template. \"Organization\" - \"Business Group\", click the business group name to enter the business group details page On the Approval Workflow tab, select the approval template and click Save After saving, the members of the business group will enter the approval workflow when applying for services Add an approval workflow to the service configuration After the service catalog is successfully applied, if the service is configured with the approval workflow in advance, the service will enter the approval queue and obtain the approval comments of the relevant members in the approval template. Deployment can be performed only after the approval is passed. Example: Select a service such as \"vSphere single-node service\" and add an approval workflow for the service in the service configuration Service Design - Catalog Config, select vSphere Single Node Service in the Service Configuration List. Click the service name to enter the Edit Service page. On the Approval Configuration page, select the approval workflow (the service configuration workflow. The content of the approval workflow can only be viewed and selected and cannot be edited or deleted.) Click Save. After saving, the application for the service needs to be approved according to the approval workflow of the template before deployment. Service applicant clicks on the service catalog in the left navigation bar, selects “vSphere Single Node Service”, and clicks to enter the service application page. Fill in the application form: including the business group (when the card is shared to all business groups), the service deployment name (if the business group does not set the service deployment naming rules), the number of deployment, project, owner, deployment reason, virtual Machine template, etc., click \"Apply\" after filling out. Check the status of the application: enter the \"Request\" - \"Pending Approval\", the application status is in \"pending approval\" status. Approval: The approver specified in the approval template logs into the system and enters the \" Requests\" - \"Pending Approval\" to select the project to be approved. Enter the approval comments, click “Approve”, a confirmation prompt will pop up, click “Yes” View the approved projects: Enter \"Requests\" - \"Approved Request\", the status of the project is \"Approval\" After the applicant logs in to the system, go to \"My Requests\" and the blueprint deployment status of the application changes to \"Approved\". In Service Deployment, the project has begun deployment. After the deployment is successful, in Service Deployment, select the service to allow the service to be operated. Custom Parallel Approval Workflow In the left navigation bar, click \"Service Design\" - \"Workflow\", click on the Add Name (Parallel Approval Workflow), Description, Category (Approval Workflow) and other information, then use the Workflow Designer to design and define the approvals workflow you need to enable. Select the parallel approval workflow and go to the Workflow Designer to customize the specific strategy graphically: Introduce the use of the workflow designer: the left circle represents the starting node, the right circle represents the ending node, and the parallel approval workflow sets two parallel approval links (approval A link, approval B link). If a request passes through the A link and passes The B link, it is successful. If any of the two links fails, the request fails. As the picture shows: Approvers can choose roles Approvers can choose roles. For example, a tenant administrator, a business group administrator, etc., can also designate a user as an approver. Built-in role usage in the approval workflow:In order to satisfy the approval workflow, we need to add an additional approval role to the approval workflow if we want approval to start with the applicant's lowest-level organizational structure and then the business group where the resource is located. When the administrator edits the approval workflow, the approver selects \"role\" and lists the built-in approval roles: \"Primary Business Group Administrator\": defined as the administrator of the lowest-level business group where the user is located \"Secondary business group administrator\": defined as the administrator of the upper-level business group where the user is located. A two-level approval workflow is added to the approval workflow. The first-level role selects the “first-level business group administrator” and the second-level role selects the “second-level business group administrator”. Approval can be initiated from the lowest organizational structure of the business group where the applicant resources are located. The approver selects the dynamic user, specifies the “dynamic user” ${FORM.approver}, customizes the form for the service, and binds the approver field at the form configuration, so that you can specify any user as the approver's needs. Approvers’ choices are based on access rights and when this workflow is used for deployment or cloud resource operational approval, only users with read access to the resource can receive approval requests. Approval changes (allow or do not allow the approver to modify) Advanced configuration (configurable specific fields that the approver can modify, such as CPU, memory, etc.) There are two types of approval rules:The first type is a fixed value, that is, if the number of approvers meets the set number, then the approval passes, and if one person refuses to pass, the approval fails. The second type is the percentage of approve members meets the set percentage. If one person rejects, the approval fails. The specific operations are divided into approval operations and execution operations: The approval operation is the authority given to the level approver to approve, reject or return the application. There is no approval permission for execution operations. It cannot reject or return but only check the application content and confirm the approval as the reviewer. In addition, you can also define whether the layer approver has the right to modify the application. If necessary, please check “allow modification to the application”. Built-in approval workflow The system has built-in tenant administrator approval workflow, business group administrator approval workflow, and approval template workflow, which is convenient for users to directly select the required approval workflow. The built-in approval workflow cannot be modified or deleted. It only supports viewing and use. The user-defined add-on approval workflow supports modification and deletion. Tenant Administrator Approval: Defined as an administrator within the tenant system where the user is located Business Group Administrator Approval: Defined as the administrator of the business group in which the user is located Approval Template Workflow: Built-in Cloud Service Deployment Approval Workflow Cloud Resource Operation Entitlement There are two ways to set permissions for cloud resource related operations. One is set in the business group - cloud resource operation entitlement; the second is set in the service configuration. The cloud resource operation entitlement in the service configuration inherits the business group configuration, and the operation item enablement and approval workflow can be changed within this scope. Operations that are not enabled in the business group cannot be enabled at the service configuration. Specific operation method: “Organization” - “Business Group”, select the “Cloud Resource Ops Entitlement” tab, which will list all enabled cloud resource operations of the business group. After the configuration is complete and the request service is deployed successfully, you can enter the instances details page in My Deployment - Instances to perform the operations on the virtual machine. Add a cloud resource operation entitlement to a business group Operational entitlement for cloud resources can be added at the business group level. \"Organization\" - \"Business Group\", select the \"Cloud Resource Ops Entitlement\" tab Click “Add” and the “Add Operation Entitlement” page appears The first column on the left side of the page lists the operations of cloud resources (including virtual machines, cloud drives, container services, network resources, etc.), the second column is the role list, the third column is the activation status list, and the rightmost column is the approval template list. Check an operation in the virtual machine operation list, such as enable, stop, suspend, etc. In the role list, select the role that can do this. In the Enable status list, you can check Do not enable (cannot perform this virtual machine operation), enable (can perform this virtual machine operation) or enable and approve (This virtual machine operation requires an approval template to be selected in the approval template list so that the operation can be performed). Approval Template: Select the default template (Business Group Administrator Approval Template or Tenant Administrator Approval Template) Click \"Save\" 「Note」When you add an operation entitlement, you can select multiple actions, multiple roles, and set the same enable and approve rules. After saving, you can modify or delete each added setting, or continue adding new operating entitlement rule settings.。 Add a cloud resource operation entitlement to the service configuration Click Service Design - Catalog Config in the left navigation bar, click the service deployment name or select a service, and click Edit to enter the Service Deployment Basic Information page. Click the “Components” tab and click the Server or Windows Server node to enter the node detailed settings interface. Click the Ops Entitlement tab, where you can configure the actions in the cloud resource and configure the required approval workflow. For each operation, different enable and approval workflowes can be configured for different roles. 「Note」Cloud resource ops entitlement list is inherited from the business group cloud resource operation entitlement. If you select \"Inherited Business group Configuration\", you can delete the entitlement within this range. If you select \"Inherited Business group Configuration\", the configuration is the same as the cloud resource operation in the business group. For details, see “Add a Cloud Resource Ops Entitlement to the Business group”. If you do not check \"Inherit Business Group Configuration\", click Edit after each operation, select the activation status and approval template and click \"Save\". Service Deployment Operation Entitlement The service deployment operation entitlement specifies the operations that can be performed after the service is successfully deployed, and the approval workflow for the operation. On the Deployment - My Deployment page, select a service deployment and the top of the list page will show what the service deployment can do. Add a service deployment operation entitlement to a business group “Organization” - “Business Group”, click the name of the business group, go to the overview page, and select the “Service Deployment Ops Entitlement” tab. Click “Add” and the “Add Operation Entitlement” page appears. The first column on the left side of the page is the operation list, the second column is the role list, the third column is the activation status list, and the rightmost column is the approval template list. Check an action in the action list, such as changing the owner, starting service deployment, stopping service deployment, and so on. In the role list, select the role that can do this. In the Enable status list, you can check Do not enable (do not do this), enable (can do this) or enable and approve (Need to select an approval template in the list of approval templates to do this). Click Save to successfully add a service deployment entitlement to the business group. Add a service deployment entitlement in the service configuration The Service Deployment Operational Entitlement stipulates that the operations in the Service Deployment Management can be enabled after the service is successfully deployed, and the required approval workflow is configured. For each operation, different enablement rules and approval workflows can be configured for different roles. Click Service Design - Catalog Config on the left navigation bar and click the service deployment name to enter the Service Deployment Basic Information page. Click the Service Deployment Operation Entitlement tab, where you can configure the actions in the service deployment and configure the required approval workflow.

If you do not check \"Inherit Business Group Configuration\", click Edit after each operation, select the activation status and approval template, click , and finally click \"Save\". Manual Ticket Service Workflow Management The manual ticket service workflow defines the specific processing steps, service teams, service personnel, and transfer methods of the ticket tasks. Built-in manual Ticket service workflow The built-in manual ticket service workflow of the platform includes standard manual tickets, standard event management workflows, application service workflows, and supports tenant administrators to customize service workflows. The built-in manual ticket workflow cannot be modified or deleted. It only supports viewing and use. The user-defined manual ticket service workflow supports modification and deletion. The standard event workflow Incident Report is used to solve problems related to IT resources, such as server down, network IP address conflicts, and so on. The workflow type belongs to the manual ticket service. The specific process is as follows: The main aspects of the standard event workflow include: first-line processing support, second-line processing support, and shutdown services. The first- and second-line task processing links can be assigned to different teams. After the first-line processing supports receiving the event, the operations that can be performed are as follows: Direct processing, after the problem is solved, fill in the cause or the description of the problem or the solution Transfer to other business groups Upgrade: Upgrade to the second line for processing and fill in the upgrade instructions After the second-line support process receives the event, the operations that can be performed are as follows: Direct processing, after the problem is solved, you can fill in the reason for the problem and the explanation of the solution Transfer to other teams The email notifies the user that the problem has been solved. After the user who initiated the manual ticket service application receives the problem-solving email, the user performs the service shutdown operation, and the ticket status changes to “processed”; if the user chooses to re-process the ticket , then return to the handler of the previous level. (When the email informs the user in the previous step, whoever processed it is returned to whom, the second-line processing returns to the second line, and the first line returns to the first line), and the ticket status changes to \"Processing\". Cloud Resource Blueprint Service Workflow Built-in standard cloud service deployment workflow Define the workflow of cloud resource automation deployment, which belongs to the cloud resource blueprint service workflow built into the system. Custom Add Workflow To meet the service process requirements of different service items, the platform has built-in multiple service processes and custom added service processes.

The agreement stipulates the time and other conditions for the completion of the service. User can associate service level agreements with services provided by the platform (for example: manual tickets, cloud resource deployment, and task execution) to ensure timely tracking of service processing. Application scenario: In the traditional resale mode, the SLA agreement is written into the contract and has someone to track it. In the new resale scenario, SmartCMP binds the SLA to the service. Service applicants and service providers can automatically track the entire process and view the service progress and the time spent in real time. Main functions: Tenant administrators can create one or more service level agreements, define service response time (two optional time units, days / hours), service agreement name, description, priority (highest, high, medium, Low), and users and roles notified by email. Service level agreements are created once and can be applied to different services repeatedly, but a service configuration can only be associated with one service level agreement. Define four SLA status: the remaining time accounts for 50% -100% of the response time, the status is normal; the remaining time accounts for 25% -50% of the response time, the status is warning; the remaining time accounts for the response time 0-25 %, the status is critical; and the remaining time is below 0, the status is overdue. For example, the tenant administrator sets the SLA response time to 4 hours. After the tenant member request service, if the remaining time for service processing is more than 2 hours, then the SLA status color is green; if the remaining time is within 1 hour and 2 hours the SLA status color is displayed in yellow; if the remaining time is within 0-1 hours, the color of the SLA status displays orange; and if it is overdue, the color of the SLA status displays red. When the SLA level changes, a notification will be sent to the role or user configured by the administrator in advance. Administrators can configure service level agreements for related services. They can be set as allowing changes when applying and published to the service catalog after the configuration is completed. When users request services through the service catalog, they can choose service level agreements as needed. If the administrator has configured a service level agreement for the service, and the service is configured with an approval process in which the SLA is not allowed to be modified on the approval page, when the approver rejects the service request and the applicant reapplies for the service, the remaining time is still calculated based on the previous request time. The following describes the configuration steps of the service level agreement. Add Service Level Agreement Tenant administrators have the authority to create, edit, and delete service level agreements. Tenant members only have the right to view. Tenant members with service configuration rights can associate service level agreements with services.

The platform supports multiple billing modes, including standard mode, professional mode, and public cloud billing. Standard mode means that the current billing specifications are billed for a single resource. You can select the cloud platform and resource bundle, specify the component type, and select specific components to set the price. For example: Set prices for all resource bundles under the Tencent cloud platform and IaaS component category instances. Professional mode, define a set of billing rules through scripts, for example: Alibaba Cloud has a variety of specifications, and the prices of different specifications are inconsistent. Use a script that supports JavaScript to define a set of Alibaba Cloud different specifications' billing price. Public cloud billing model, for public cloud resale business scenarios, tenant administrators can set different discount factors, currency conversion, and bill synchronization for different resources. Billing rules support multiple currency units, including RMB, USD, Saudi Riyal, etc. Tenant administrators can select a currency unit in the system configuration, (default RMB) can choose Saudi Riyal or US dollar. After that, the billing rules and the currency unit when the fund account is recharged are kept consistent with the configuration. The following describes the steps for adding, editing, and deleting billing rules: Click \"Billing & Usage\"-\"Billing Rules\" in the left menu bar, you will see a list of the created billing rules which lists the information of the resource types and prices that have been created.

The platform not only supports the use of embedded bastion hosts, but can also be connected to third-party bastion hosts. Core usage scenarios: Permission management: Integrate the access control of the bastion host and the platform (the platform and the bastion host are connected to the permission system, set user permissions, and set whether users can connect to the virtual machine through SSH or RDP. User management: all users accessing the virtual machine need to go through the bastion host. Operations: after the virtual machine is created, register the virtual machine to the bastion host; after the virtual machine is deleted, log out the virtual machine from the bastion host; after the virtual machine changes, update the bastion host. For example when a virtual machine’s owner is changed, the registration information of the virtual machine in the bastion host is modified synchronously. Session management and video playback: The platform also supports the bastion host session management function. When the user performs operations on the remote instance through the bastion host, a real-time session link will be formed, and the tenant administrator can view the current ongoing session. If an exception is found, the administrator can manually terminate one or more sessions by clicking terminate to disconnect the corresponding user's session. User can also view the history of all the sessions, learn the details of each historical session, and click playback to view the recording.

Bind the bastion host to the resource bundle: Click the \"Infrastructure\"-\"Resource Bundle Management\" on the left navigation bar, and specify one of the bastion hosts that have been connected. For example: when adding a vSphere resource bundle, bind the bastion host Guacd, the virtual machine deployed using the vSphere resource bundle will be automatically registered to the bastion host, and the virtual machine deployed using the vSphere resource bundle will be automatically unregistered from the bastion host when it is uninstalled. Use of the bastion host. After the vSphere resource bundle is bound to the bastion host, use the vSphere resource bundle to successfully deploy the instance. Click the left navigation bar \"Deployments\"-\"Instance\"-\"Overview\" tab, select Remote protocol types, including: based on cloud platform, RDP or VNC (choose based on RDP or VNC, you need to select the remote protocol port). After the selection is completed, click \"Remote Terminal\" and you can directly pass \"RDP or VNC\". The instance is configured to open the remote terminal on the cloud platform. You can modify the parameters of the protocol information through the remote terminal, for example, modify the user name and password of the virtual machine. Every time the operation personnel logs in to the virtual machine through Web SSH for operation, system will automatically use the bastion host's Web SSH service, and each connection will generate a session record of operation. Audit personnel may click on the \"Backup & Security\"-\"Guacamole\"-active session on the left navigation bar to check if there's any illegal operation, if found, they can manually click the \"terminate\" button to immediately terminate the session.

Cloud resource blueprint service scenario The Cloud Resource Blueprint Service is based on blueprint modeling to define standard service frameworks and components, providing a rich set of out-of-the-box software components to visualize blueprints for automated deployment. For example, configuring a vSphere single-node virtual machine service is a typical scenario for a cloud resource blueprint service. Ticket service scenario The user applies for a service through the service catalog, and the service group receives and performs the ticket processing operation. There are two types of ticket services: Apply for non-standardized resources (for example, apply for a cloud resource blueprint service to uninstall a service deployment.) Services that require IT manual intervention (for example, manual ticket service for resetting passwords.) 「Note」For more guidance on cloud resource blueprint service and manual ticket service, please refer to:Cloud Resource Guidelines和Request Service This chapter helps users get started with service request and self-service. Service request: In the Service Catalog, you can use the quick request function, select the required blueprint, apply quickly, and automate the deployment. Self-service operation: View detailed information about service deployment, instances or cloud resources in the Deployments menu, and perform self-service operation. The next section will explain how to request service. Log in Enter SmartCMP IP in browser, such as: http://SmartCMP-Public-IP/#/login and enter username & password Request Service After the service is successfully published, you can view and apply for the published service in service catalog. Click Service Catalog, select the vSphere single-node service or OpenStack single-node service configured in the previous section, and click to enter the service request interface. View the details of the service on this page, such as: organization information, deployment information, application parameters, etc. Fill in/modify relevant information, if not enter the next step directly Click Apply and the request is successful after approved by the process control (approval template) of the business group. Since Default business group has no approval process, service will be deployed directly after request. Self-service Operation After the service is requested, you can check the status of the deployment in Deployment - My Deployment. If there is an approval process, you can go to “Requests” - “Pending Approval” to view the current approval process. Click on the service deployment request number to enter the approval details page of the blueprint deployment to view the current approval process. If there is no approval process, click on the service deployment name to go to the deployment details page to view basic information, topology and operation history. If the service has already started deployment, you can view the current deployment process in the operation history. Go to \"Deployment\" - \"My Deployment\" - \"Operation History\", select the action to view the current deployment process below. Or click the operation history in the upper right corner of the platform, click the operation you just applied to enter the operation history details page; or click “View All” to enter the operation history list interface, click the “operation name” of the service you just applied to enter the operation history details page to view the progress of the operation. View Deployment Details and Self-Service Operation After the service is successfully deployed, you can view the detailed information about the service deployment and the monitoring information of the instances and application components on the My Deployment page. A service deployment consists of one or more instances. After selecting “Deployment” - “My Deployment”, you will see the service deployment list, which can be filtered by business group, stage (running, operation processing, shutdown, failed), state (normal, abnormal), owner or project in advanced search, or directly search operation. In the service deployment list, you can select one or more service deployments to quickly perform some operations, including stop, installation SW, copy, extended expiration time, tear down, delete management information, change owner, change project, change business group and update Exts (example is vSphere service deployment and operation of different cloud platforms are different) 「Note」 Users can see the list of allowed operations after the deployment is generated only if the operating entitlement of the virtual machine is configured when tenant admin sets up the business group or the service is configured. Default business group defaults all operations by the business group administrator and there is no approval process Click on the name to view the details of the service deployment including \"Basic Information\", \" Topology\", \"Operation History\" and \"Monitoring\" (Monitoring of VMs and Application Components) Basic Information: Includes name, business group, project, blueprint, resource bundle, cloud platform, and related information such as cost, status, and time. It also includes a list of input parameters for the service deployment and output result information. After the service deployment fails, some scenarios can be repaired offline. If the repair is successful, the service deployment status will be changed to \"Running\". Topology: Includes blueprints, details, and process information for service deployment. Hovering over the service topology map will display the key information of the node. For example, the server node will display the instance name, guest operating system, IP address, memory, total disk space, number of vCPUs, CPU usage, memory usage, etc. History: Shows the operation history of the service deployment Monitoring: Shows monitoring information for instances and application components in the deployment. View Deployment Details and Self-Service Operation At the same time, instance status and details can be managed and operated in \"Instances \". The enabling and approval of the operation needs to be set at the business group level or service configuration level. Select “Deployments” - “Instances”, you will see a list of instances. In “Advanced Search”, you can filter by business group, state (started, lost, stopped), owner, project and tag. Click on \"Show Columns\" to select or not select certain columns for display. In this list, you can select one or more instances to quickly perform some operations, including \"Start\", \"Reboot\", \"Suspend\", \"Stop\", \"Run Script\", \"Set Tag\", \"Enable/Switch Monitoring\". \"Update Monitoring Agent\", \"Update Automation Agent\", etc. You can also click on an instance to enter its details interface for management and operation, including “Basic Information”, “History”, “Snapshot”, “Monitoring”, “Application List” tab and the top operation list. 「Note」Monitoring and tags may only be viewed if this instance is installed monitoring and applications and deployed successfully. Basic Information: Basic information about the virtual machine and its associated hosts, such as: name, operating system, installed software, vCPU, memory, status, SSH port, automation agent, monitoring mode, monitoring port, lease/retention expiration time, etc. Relationships: server information, resource bundles, data storage, virtual machine storage policies, network labels, etc. Physical host information Users and groups Organizational information: service deployment name, service name, business group, tenant, project, etc. Operating status IP address Key-value labels 「Note」More host related information will be determined according to different cloud platforms and different service configuration items History includes the operation history of the virtual machine Snapshot displays the current snapshot information (snapshot name, creation time, etc.), and ”refresh”, “add”, “restore” and “delete” the snapshot Monitoring includes monitoring data of the virtual machine CPU, memory, disk, and network (you can adjust the time span or average time to view historical monitoring data as needed) 「Note」Only after the instance configured with monitoring in VM templates is deployed successfully can data be seen in monitoring. Application List displays the list of applications that are currently installed on the virtual machine (if the virtual machine does not have an application installed, the application list menu is not displayed) Operation includes a list of operations that can be performed by the virtual machine. The specific operation introduction will be expanded later. 「Note」Users can see the list of allowed operations after the deployment is generated only if the operating entitlement of the virtual machine is configured when the business group is set or the service is configured. Default business group defaults all operations to the business group administrator and there is no approval process. View Cloud Resource Details In Resources, you can view and manage related cloud resource status and detail. Select \"Deployments\" - \" Resources\", you will see the following categories: storage, container, network, PaaS and software.

For example, the server node will display the instance name, guest operating system, IP address, memory, total disk space, number of vCPUs, CPU usage, memory usage, etc. Operation History shows the operation history of the service deployment Monitoring displays monitoring information applied to components in the deployment Service Deployment and Operation You can perform operations on the service deployment in the service deployment list interface or by clicking the service deployment name to enter the service deployment details interface. 「Note」The operation permissions of the service deployment are controlled by the business group and service configuration. Here we assume the user has the authority to operate. For your convenience, platform groups operations into several groups. Change Organization Information Change owner Changing the owner of a service deployment will also change the owner of all virtual machines under the service deployment. Choose the target owner, who is a member of the business group. Change project Changing the project to which the service is deployed will also change the project of all virtual machines under the service deployment. Select the target project and select the user under the project. Change business group All virtual machines under the service deployment will be changed to the new business group at the same time, and the relevant information such as the owner will be modified. Select the target business group, the project (optional), the owner (the member under the business group), and the resource bundle (the resource bundle under the business group). If the resource pool list is empty, it means that no resources are available on the business group. Start Service Deployment The Start Service Deployment action is available if the service deployment is down. This task can be triggered by timing (sometime in the future) by setting \"Enable Timing\". Stop Service Deployment If the service deployment is in a running state, you can \"stop service deployment\", which will shut down all virtual machines under the service deployment. This task can be triggered by timing (sometime in the future) by setting \"Enable Timing\". Dismount Service Deployment After the service is deployed, the cloud resources under the service deployment can be removed. Dismounting a service deployment will remove all new resources created in SmartCMP. If the service deployment includes shared resources, the shared resources will not be deleted; if the service deployment contains existing resources, such as LoadBalance \"Use existing resources\", the existing resources will not be deleted; if you are the resources owner after you import the resources, you can delete imported resources. Re-execute deployment The deployment node can be re-executed after the service is deployed.

Software components associate with product warehouse and custom application deployment methods and related parameters. Define application services: Model the application architecture through blueprint modeling; specify resource parameters and versions of related applications through service configuration. Define the pipeline: configure the pipeline stage and various types of tasks to achieve full lifecycle management of application testing, deployment, update, operation and recycling. SmartCMP supports permission management for continuous integration and release functions. When the administrator configures the pipeline, the administrator binds a project to the pipeline and adds global parameters to be called in the later tasks. The project team members under the project have the authority to add, edit, delete, execute, disable, lock the automation pipeline, and view the execution history of the pipeline. Pipeline SmartCMP's pipeline helps users build automated, reusable, and securely compliant applications for continuous delivery and deployment. The pipeline consists of a series of stages, each consisting of multiple tasks and environments that the software must complete before it is released to production. Currently, it supports the customization and assembly of multiple phases and tasks and can add any number of execution tasks in the stage. Through them, it is possible to design development, deployment, and operation pipelines applicable to various scenarios. Add a pipeline, bind a project, and add global parameters to make calls in later tasks.

Specific ticket service function description: Ticket Request: Supports users to apply for ticket services in the service catalog. Ticket Tracking: After the service catalog request form is completed, it supports the user to enter My Requests to view the service details. Below you will be introduced to the detailed steps of the ticket request and tracking process. Request Ticket Users can apply for a configured service or shared service in the service catalog. Click “Service Catalog” in the left navigation bar, select manual ticket service, click to enter the service request page. In the service request page, fill in the details of the service: title, ticket description, priority, urgency, applicant, email, mobile phone number. When the administrator has configured additional field information for the form, the user can fill in the required fields on the details page. For example, to apply for a new project, the administrator configures the fields (projects, descriptions, project members) for the form, and the user fills in the relevant information when applying for a new project. Click Apply and the ticket service is applied successfully. Track tickets After the user initiates the ticket request in the service catalog, according to the pre-configured process of the administrator, the system distributes the ticket to the corresponding service group according to the relationship between the service group and the ticket. After the specified user or role in the service team receives the ticket request, they can take the ticket voluntarily or transfer to others, or process offline, and the ticket status is updated after completion. When the administrator associates the service level agreement for the ticket service, which defines the expected time for the service to complete, both the service initiator and the acceptor can track the service in time to improve service efficiency. The user can view the details of the SLA and the remaining time (the difference from the expected service resolution time at this moment). The system will notify the user via email. The user can close the service request, the ticket status is changed to processed, and the service request is completed. If the user request to re-process the ticket, the ticket will be returned to the service group for re-processing, and the ticket status is changed to being processed. There are two types of service requests: cloud resource blueprint service requests and manual ticket service requests.Tracking the manual ticket service process and seeing the details of the manual ticket service are similar to the method of viewing the cloud resource blueprint service request details above.
