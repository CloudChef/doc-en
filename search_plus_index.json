Tenants are the architectural units in SmartCMP. In a SmartCMP deployment, multiple tenants can be configured. Tenants provide isolation boundaries for resource usage and management configurations. The dedicated configuration in each tenant is listed below: Logo and theme color: Different logo and theme color schemes can be customized for each tenant and configured in the management control interface. User: Each tenant has independent user management. You can create a local user while users of tenant A can only access tenant A and cannot access other tenants. You can also configure each tenant with a directory service for authentication, like Microsoft Active Directory or another LDAP server. Multiple tenants can use the same directory service, but the same user can belong to only one tenant, and users with the same ID cannot be configured in different tenants. Entitlement: Each tenant has an independent entitlement configuration. The permissions configured in tenant A are limited to the scope of tenant A and do not work for other tenants. Workflow: Each tenant administrator can configure workflows, such as approval processes, service processes, etc., to be applied within the scope of this tenant. Cloud platform management and resource bundle configuration: Each tenant admin or infrastructure admin can connect and manage the cloud platform portals required for the tenant, such as VMware vCenter, AWS/Azure/Alibaba cloud, etc. You can configure and manage different cloud platform portals in different tenants, or you can share the same cloud platform portals by configuring different resource bundles to access different computing resources (for example, different clusters in vCenter) for users in different tenants. Service Catalog: Each tenant's architect can design a service blueprint for the tenant. The administrator publishes the service catalog that the user can self-request according to different departments and environments. Categories and service items in the service catalog remain independent among different tenants. Tenant Single tenant and multiple tenants Single tenant In single tenant deployment, all configurations appear in the default tenant. Administrators can manage cloud resources and organizational structures and configure specific service catalogs within tenants. Multiple tenants In multi-tenant environment, each tenant has a separate configuration that is managed by the administrator. System administrators can configure, view and manage configurations in multiple tenants. Business group and projects Within each tenant, different organizational structures may be created including business groups and projects. Business group A business group is a logical organizational structure within a tenant. User can creates a corresponding business group for a company's department, organization, or business unit. Tenant administrators can create multi-level business groups, and users associated with business groups can use resources and services in the business group. Independent rules, processes, and resources can be configured for each business group: Associate one or more resource bundles with each business group Associate users with each business group. Configure different approval processes, operation permissions, cloud resource usage leases, cloud resource naming specifications, etc. Project In SmartCMP, cloud resources within a project are visible to all members of the project and are invisible to all members of other projects. A project is subordinate to a business group and can contain multiple users. A user can join multiple projects. Role A role consists of a set of permissions that can be associated with a user to determine the functions that the user can manage, configure, and use in SmartCMP. Based on individual responsibilities, each user can be associated with one or more roles, and the permissions will be a superposition of those roles. After deployment of SmartCMP, following roles will be provided by default: Tenant roles overview A tenant-wide role has the corresponding responsibilities of that particular tenant and does not affect other tenants in the system. You can create custom roles as needed to be associated with users. Tenant Admin Usually responsible for the overall tenant structure. Tenant administrators configure SmartCMP based on their tenants' internal organizational needs, responsible for tenant internal process and policy configuration, organizational structure configuration, user and permission configuration, and more. Main duty: Create and manage users and tenant roles, assign roles and permissions to users and create service teams Create and manage business groups and assign business group administrators to each business group Create and manage service processes and approval processes Perform tenant system configuration, including catalog service information, mail system information, access to dashboards and reports, etc. Software Architect Usually responsible for designing services that companies and organizations need to apply for and use. Services come in a variety of styles, from a single virtual machine to complex applications including network load balancing, web applications, and databases. Main duty: Create and manage software components Create and modify blueprints, model them according to business needs, and define the components included in the blueprint, including infrastructure components and software components Publish a blueprint Unpublish and delete blueprints that need to be removed Infrastructure administrator The infrastructure administrator connects one or more cloud platforms to each tenant, manages virtual machine templates (that is, operating system images) in the cloud platform, and calculates specifications (that is, instance types). Create a resource pool, specify the infrastructure resources of each cloud platform, and assign them to the business group for use. At the same time, according to the blueprint designed by the software architect, infra admin can make configurations for different business groups or environment requirements and publish to service catalog. Main duty: Connect cloud platform Create and distribute resource bundles and manage cloud platform and inventory cloud resources Configure and manage VM templates (that is, operating system images) of the cloud platform and computing specifications (that is, instance types). Manage IP address pool Configure and publish services based on blueprints released by software architects Manage service catalog Analyze resource utilization and recycle expired resources Business group roles overview A role on a business group scope has the corresponding responsibilities of that particular business group and does not affect other business groups. BG admin Manage one or more business groups, usually department managers. Main duty: Add users to business group and associate roles Configure policies such as lease duration and naming specification for cloud resources Configure business group cloud resource operation entitlement and service deployment operation entitlement, specify the operations that the user can perform (such as powering on and off, adding disks, adjusting configuration, etc.) and the required approval process Create a project and assign a project administrator Monitor resource utilization in the business group. If resources are scarce, you can apply for resource expansion BG member All users in a business group can request services published to the business group (including services shared to all business groups). Users can request services from the service catalog and manage the resources they own. Main duty: Self-service request. Check configuration and monitoring information of owned cloud resources to perform self-service operation (the operation entitlement is configured by business group). Self-service alert setting for the cloud resources it owns. Project roles overview A role on a project scope has the corresponding responsibility for that particular project and does not affect other projects. Project Admin Manage one or more projects, usually project managers. Main duty: Add users to the project and associate roles View cloud resources owned by the project Project member Project member is also a member of the business group to which the project belongs, so it can request publishing services to the business group and can view resources and perform operations. At the same time,all members of the same project can view the resources in this project. Service Group Service group is a collection of service personnel who process request services during the request service management process. Tenant administrators can create one or more service groups and assign members to each service group. Main duty: After the user applies for the manual work order service that needs manual intervention through the service catalog, according to the pre-configured service process, the corresponding service group will receive the work order for processing. After receiving the work order, the personnel in the service group can transfer, or perform offline processing, update the work order status after completing the task, and return the work order to the request user for confirmation and closure.

After connecting the cloud platform, you can distribute resources such as calculation, storage, and network through resource bundles to be assigned to different service groups. At the same time, you can create virtual machine templates and computing specifications (that is, instance types) in SmartCMP, and encapsulate and abstract virtual machine templates (or operating system images) and computing specifications (that is, instance types) of each cloud platform for unified management and automated calls. Cloud platform You can enter access information for each cloud platform in SmartCMP to connect and manage. For example, virtualization management controller address, username and password, or public cloud access key. The following table lists the information that needs to be entered for each cloud platform portal: Cloud Platform Type Connect Method vSphere vCenter Server OpenStack OpenStack Management Controller PowerVC PowerVC Management Controller Hyper-V Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager(SCVMM) Server Physical Machine SmartCMP physical server management node information Aliyun Aliyun Service Account AccessKey AWS AWS Service Account AccessKey Microsoft Azure Azure API Access Credentials Tencent Cloud Tencent Cloud Service Account AccessKey QingCloud QingCloud Service Account AccessKey VMware NSX NSX Management Controller Cisco ACI ACI Management Controller F5 F5 Management Controller Cloud Gateways The enterprise's infrastructure and network environment are relatively complex. There are scenarios such as isolation between multiple data centers, virtual network environments, and hybrid cloud architecture. Based on this, SmartCMP uses a distributed architecture and connects to different network environments with the help of cloud gateways to monitor and manage the resources in each VPC, data center, or cloud environment. Users only need to create and manage a cloud gateway for each data center, VPC, or remote site for connection and communication. Resource Bundle In a resource bundle, you can specify a set of resource objects in the cloud platform as resource portals for deploying virtual machines or other cloud resources. The resource object can be a cluster of computers in a virtualization platform or an area of a public cloud. Resources, such as computing, storage, and network, are classified and specified through resource bundles,and are distributed to different business groups for consumption and use by members in the business group. For example, you can assign different datastores and virtual switches in a vSphere cluster to different resource bundles, allowing different departments to deploy resources using different storage and networks. Or specify public-cloud-specific zones, availability zones, and VPC to enable the public cloud services deployed through the resource bundle to uniformly use the resources of the available area and isolate network from other services through VPC. The following table lists the resource entrance configurations for each cloud platform resource bundle: Cloud Platform Type Resource Bundle Entrance vSphere vSphere Cluster OpenStack OpenStack Availability Zone PowerVC PowerVC Availability Zone Hyper-V Hyper-V Cluster Aliyun Aliyun Zone, Availability Zone, and VPC AWS AWS Zone, Availability Zone, and VPC Microsoft Azure Azure Subscription ID, zone, and resource group QingCloud QingCloud Zone, Availability Zone, and VPC One or more resource bundles (including multiple resource bundles from the same cloud platform) can be associated with each business group. At the same time, each resource bundle can be assigned to one business group or shared to multiple or all service groups. You can: Specify the computing resources of the virtualization platform, or the area of the public cloud, the availability zone, etc. Set the available resource quota, including the number of CPUs, the amount of memory, the number of virtual machines that can be deployed, etc. Specify specific storage resources and network resources Manually import the inventory resources in the cloud platform or set a timing policy to automatically synchronize the inventory resources in the cloud platform. For example, you can create a vSphere resource bundle: Specify a vSphere cluster in the managed vCenter to provide computing resources; Set the resource quota of the resource bundle: the number of CPUs, the amount of memory, the number of virtual machines that can be deployed, the number of snapshots allowed, and so on; Specify the data stores that can be used and set the storage space available for each data store; Specify the virtual switch that can be used and set the IP address allocation method. Virtual Machine Template You can define one or more operating systems (such as CentOS) in SmartCMP. Operating system is a logical concept. Each operating system can be associated with templates or images from different cloud platforms (for example, a CentOS virtual machine template in vCenter, or a CentOS image in Aliyun). Operating system and virtual machine templates will be used when the service is configured. Computing Specification Computing specification defines the configuration specifications of the computer CPU and memory. On SmartCMP, like the operating system, computing specification is a logical concept, and you can associate specifications or instance types in different cloud platforms for each computing specification (such as specifications in the OpenStack platform, or instance types in the AWS public cloud). Wait). Computing specifications and cloud platform specifications will be used during service configuration. Through the abstraction of the operating system and computing specifications, you can create different operating systems as needed to associate virtual machine templates that conform to enterprise security specifications. At the same time, create different computing specifications and specify specific instance types (such as reserved instance types that have been purchased). You can specify the operating system and virtual machine templates when the service is being configured and publish standardized services for users to apply. IP Address Management You can create and manage IP pools to automate the allocation of IP addresses when deploying cloud resources. IP pools can support multi-cloud heterogeneous environments, for example creating an IP pool and assigning it to vSphere and OpenStack platforms at the same time. With IP address management, you can view the utilization of IP addresses, history logs, and manually occupy and release IP addresses. Copyright © 2016-2020 CloudChef. All Rights Reserved. Shanghai CloudChef Information Technology Co., Ltd.            update time： 2020-05-22 14:36:10 "},"foundationConcepts/04ServiceCatalog/":{"url":"foundationConcepts/04ServiceCatalog/","title":"Service Catalog","keywords":"","body":"Service Model In SmartCMP, there are two types of services: Cloud Resource Blueprint Service: Refers to the request and automatic deployment of each cloud platform resource. These services can be infrastructure services (such as virtual machines, firewalls, DNS, etc.), application services (such as databases, or integrated applications including network load balancing, Web components, and databases), etc. Manual Request Service: Services that are not standardized and require manual intervention and support, including service requests, event handling, and so on. For example, if the user forgets the password which needs to be reset or submits a request to open an email or account or encounters an IT service problem which needs to be resolved (the server, printer or network cannot be accessed, etc.). The user can initiate a work order request service through the service catalog, and the service team will receive the request and process. The following diagram depicts the logical connections between components, blueprints, services, and deployments. Components include software components and infrastructure components. Software architect builds the topology map of the application and configures resources and parameters for the service, publishing the service card to the service catalog. Members of the business group apply for self-service in the service catalog according to actual needs, and the services are automatically combined according to policies and specifications to complete automated deployment and delivery. Component Any resource is a component object. Whether it is software, infrastructure or container resources, different types of cloud resources are component objects and can be componentized. The definition of components adopts an object-oriented design method, uses a unified data structure for modeling, and standardizes configuration properties. SmartCMP provides not only built-in rich component resources and common operations, but also highly scalable capabilities, flexibly add component resources and configure operations according to user needs. Rich component library: component resources out of the box. SmartCMP cloud management platform has a large number of commonly used component resources built in, including IaaS (cloud hosts, networks, storage, etc. of different cloud platforms), PaaS (servers, databases, RDS, etc.), containers (Kubernetes, Docker), software (MySQL, Oracle, Nginx, etc.) and agents (monitoring agents, automation agents). Different types of resources are created and managed in a unified interface, using a tree-like grouping directory, supporting custom component grouping, supporting secondary editing, fast copying, Import and export components. 「Note」Detailed creation and management steps please refer to: component library Custom components: Users can create reusable components according to their needs, componentize any resource, and standardize the process of configuring components, including defining resource types, versions, attributes, component operations, etc., and all configuration interfaces are open to user customization. For example, when a DBA creates a database cluster and an Oracle database needs to be deployed, DBA can add Oracle components to the component library and configure components according to requirements, including configuring component profiles, instructions, properties, scripts, and operations (create, start, stop, restart, delete, etc. the specified database) 「Note」 For detailed steps of the custom component, please refer to: Creating a component Component builds up blueprint A component is the basic unit that makes up a blueprint. The components in SmartCMP consist of two types: Infrastructure components: including computing components (e.g., virtual machines, containers, etc.), network components (e.g., load balancing, security groups, firewalls, etc.), storage components (e.g., disks, object storage, etc.). These components are built into SmartCMP and can be selected during blueprint design. Software components: for the installation of application software, including middleware, relational databases, non-relational databases, and so on. You can standardize configuration properties and use scripts to specify how to install, configure, uninstall, or update components during software deployment (you can also customize the other operations you need). Software architects can create custom components, update existing components, or delete components that have been removed through the software component management interface. Software components can be used with infrastructure components when designing blueprints. 「Note」SmartCMP has a large number of commonly used components built in. When you add custom infrastructure components or software components, you can choose to instantiate them when you add them so that you can also choose them during blueprint design. Object-oriented design The design of components adopts the structure of object-oriented design. Object-oriented has three characteristics of encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. Inheritance allows child categories to have various properties and methods of the parent category without the need to write the same code again. While making the child category inherit the parent category, you can redefine certain properties and rewrite certain methods, that is, to override the original properties and methods of the parent category, so that it has different functions from the parent category. Operations and attributes are inheritable. Start, stop, restart, delete, and refresh the built-in components of the system. (Take the refresh operation as an example, the operation is configured in system in advance, and the implementation methods, scripts, tasks, and parameters necessary for the operation are used.) The built-in operation can be applied to any resource on the platform. Therefore, when the component Oracle is created, the built-in \"start, stop, restart, delete, refresh\" operations are automatically inherited. When the component type Software is selected, the created Oracle component has various attributes of the parent Software component and can also be customized to obtain different functions from the parent one. It should be noted that the attribute key value added by the user and the attribute key value in the parent component cannot be the same, otherwise the attribute definition in the parent component will be overwritten. You can also add a script file by creating a new file, which will be used to extend the component. For example: the custom component Oracle's install.sh script will be associated with the \"create operation\". Encapsulation hides the implementation details of complex operations and only provides public access to the outside world. The platform has complex operations built-in and works out of the box, reducing differences and difficulty in understanding. For example: \"adjust virtual machine configuration\" operation (adjust virtual machine calculation specifications and cloud platform specifications), when the cloud platform type is different, the SmartCMP cloud management platform hides the details of the flow of resource operations, only exposing public access interfaces. For example, the \"Adjust virtual machine configuration\" operation is applied to a virtual machine on the Hyper-V platform and a virtual machine on the OpenStack platform. The specific technical implementation is different, but the user configuration interface displays the same content. Polymorphism refers to the same operation, which has a different effect due to different parameters passed in. For example, when the component Oracle is created, different application systems have specific requirements and custom requirements for Oracle's deployment requirements and parameter control. \"Attributes\" can be set according to the deployment requirements of different systems, by setting custom attributes, exposing configuration parameters that application components need to fill out to the interface configuration, and passing custom parameters. When Oracle is deployed automatically, the SmartCMP cloud management platform automatically invokes relevant parameters to perform application installation and configuration, which meets different requirements for Oracle deployment in different data clusters. Blueprint A blueprint is a complete specification of the overall application, including computing, storage, networking, software, etc., used to determine attributes and dependencies, workflows, and execution strategies for various resources. You can create a standardized service framework by designing blueprint on visualized canvas and combining one or more components. Once the blueprint is published, it can be used to create a service. Blueprints can take many forms, for example, a blueprint may contain: A network component and a virtual machine component A firewall component or a public cloud relational database component Multi-level application architecture, such as: network load balancing, web applications and databases A hybrid orchestration of multiple cloud platform components, such as a web application deployed in Aliyun while a database in a vSphere private cloud, or a web application in a Kubernetes container while a database in an OpenStack private cloud. Workflow Workflow defines the sequence and strategy of activities or tasks performed at each step in the automated process. Workflows in SmartCMP are divided into the following three types. Each type includes a built-in process that can be used directly. These built-in processes cannot be modified or deleted. You can also customize the workflows you need through a visual process designer. Cloud Resource Blueprint Service: Defines the process of automated deployment of cloud resources, including built-in workflows for standard cloud service deployment. Manual Request Service: Defines the task and flow mode of each step of the request service, including built-in workflows such as standard manual requests and standard event management. Approval process: It is used to control whether a user should obtain approval of someone in the organization when applying for service or performing operations on a cloud resource. Please remind that in those versions before 5.1 or those upgraded from the old version, the approval process configuration menu is provided for compatibility with the approval process in the old version. However, this feature will be turned off in the future, and it is recommended that you use workflow to create and manage the approval process. Form When a user requests a service in the service catalog, each service you create and publish displays a form. When creating or configuring each service, you can use the default form. If you need to modify or add additional field information for users to fill in at the time of request, you can customize the form through the form designer. Catalog Group Catalog groups are used to organize different services into related types, making it easier for users to browse the services they need. For example: infrastructure services, database services, manual request services, and more. You can create new groups as needed to categorize the services you need to publish. Service Publishing Tenant administrators or infrastructure administrators can deploy blueprints and workflows that have been released, according to different organizational or departmental requirements, and publish them as services in the service catalog. A service can be published to a business group so that only members of the business group can apply while it can also be posted to all business groups and shared with all members for request. In the process of service configuration: For cloud resource deployment services, you can specify a complete specification of the deployment, such as virtual machine configuration (required virtual machine template, computing size, disk configuration, etc.), lease, operation entitlement, approval process, service workflow, customization forms, etc. For request services, you can specify the service team, approval process, service workflow, custom form, and more for each step of the task. Lease Period Lease period includes the lease time, retention time and recycle bin recovery time: When the lease time expires, all computing resources in the service deployment will be shut down; When the retention time expires, the service deployment will be placed in the recycle bin; In the Recycle Bin, you can restore or manually delete them (the resources will be completely released from the cloud platform). If you do nothing, the resources will be automatically deleted after the reclaim time expires (these resources will be completely released from the cloud platform). Approval Process Approval process can be set up separately in business group and service configuration: Approval process configured by the business group will take effect for all services in the business group; If a service is configured with an approval process separately, the process will override those in the business group. If no process is configured, the approval process for the business group configuration will be used. Service Deployment When user request the cloud resource service, after approval (if the approval process is configured), SmartCMP will be deployed according to the policy and specification of the service configuration, and then delivered to the user for use. Service deployment refers to all cloud resources included in the service requested by the user, such as a virtual machine, a database, or a multi-tiered application environment. Users can use all the resources deployed by the service during the configured service lease period and can self-service operations or changes according to the operation entitlement configured by the administrator. Naming Policies Define the service deployment and cloud resource naming policies through the specification template and configure them globally. All business groups are configured by default. Different business groups can also be individually selected for configuration as needed to override global settings. Use naming policies to standardize the name of the service deployment and the cloud resources, including the service deployment name, instance display name, and Windows or Linux operating system host name (Hostname). To ensure the uniqueness of naming, users can add a naming suffix to the policy. The naming suffix can be a number sequence with a custom length or a random character string with a custom length. User can specify the initialization sequence number for the numeric sequence. For example, user can create a naming suffix with a length of 3 and an initialization sequence number of 1. The instance names deployed by the group will be Dev001, Dev002, and so on. Entitlement Profiles The entitlement profile defines the operations that users can perform on service deployment and cloud resources. Users can configure the approval process and can apply a set of entitlement profiles to all business groups, or allow different business groups to associate entitlement profiles independently template. Entitlement refers to the changes or operations authorized that the user may perform on service deployment or cloud resources. You can disable or enable certain operations and set up approval processes for the enabled operations. There are two types of entitlements: Deployment’s entitlement refers to operations on the service deployment level, including extending the lease period of the service deployment, changing the business group, project, owner, etc. Cloud resource’s entitlement refers to operations on instances or other cloud resources, including power on / off, remote connection, disk addition, migration, etc. In the entitlement profiles interface, multiple sets of entitlement profiles that meet the usage scenario can be created: In the system configuration interface, configure an entitlement profile for all business groups, and all business groups will be configured by default. The entitlement profile configured separately for each business group will take effect for all service deployment and cloud resources for that business group. Copyright © 2016-2020 CloudChef.

Cloud resource blueprint service scenario The Cloud Resource Blueprint Service is based on blueprint modeling to define standard service frameworks and components, providing a rich set of out-of-the-box software components to visualize blueprints for automated deployment. For example, configuring a vSphere single-node virtual machine service is a typical scenario for a cloud resource blueprint service. After the blueprint is modeled by the administrator, the service configuration can specify the resources and parameters that the user can apply for, and form a standard service based on the blueprint. After the release, the user can apply for self-service and automate the delivery. Ticket service scenario There are two types of ticket services: Apply for non-standardized resources (for example, apply for a cloud resource blueprint service to uninstall a service deployment. This action is a typical service scenario for ticket services) Services that require IT manual intervention (for example, manual ticket service for resetting passwords. This action is also a typical service scenario for ticket services) 「Note」Please refer to Quick Configuration of Cloud Resource Blueprint Services for more cloud resource blueprint services. For detailed ticket service please go to Request service Management When using the system release service for the first time, you need to do the following to configure the system: Configure the cloud platform portal: administrator login information such as vSphere and OpenStack. Add IP Pool: Define the range of available IP addresses Define resource bundles: configure available physical resources and set quotas, such as CPU, memory, storage, network, etc. Define business groups, associated personnel, resource bundles, configuration approval process, deployment specifications, etc. Define virtual machine templates: Select the cloud platform and the corresponding template or image Define blueprints: define the architecture of the service and automate the installation logic Configure and publish the service: associate the blueprint to the service group and resource bundle, and configure the deployment parameters, such as selecting a VM template. Request service: Apply for service in the service catalog. You can also enable the guided application function of the business group in the \"Organization\" - \"Business Groups\" Self-service operation: View detailed information about service deployment, instances or cloud resources in Deployment menu, and perform self-service operation. The next chapter will explain how the administrator configures the first cloud resource, publishes and requests the service. Log in Enter SmartCMP IP in browser, such as: http：//SmartCMP-Public-IP/#/login Enter username & password. Configure cloud platform portal The cloud platform portal defines the cloud infrastructure resources of the public cloud, private cloud, container, or physical machine that SmartCMP manages. Different cloud infrastructure account has different forms and acquisition methods. The administrator can complete the registration of the cloud platform infrastructure by filling in the corresponding infrastructure access information. 「Note」Please use the tenant administrator or infrastructure administrator to log in to the SmartCMP platform.

Define Resource bundles SmartCMP can map resources in a cloud platform to multiple logical units by defining resource bundles, and configure them to different organizational structures, thereby designating different organizations and users to use the infrastructure resources in the cloud platform, including computing, storage and network resources, etc. A cloud platform can define a resource bundle or multiple resource bundles. Define the relationship between the resource bundle and the service group. There are three types of resource sharing: The resource bundle is only assigned to a unique service group. Operation method: Do not select \"Allow sharing to multiple business groups\", click \"Business Group\" to select the business group. The resource bundle is assigned to all service groups, and the newly added service group is automatically associated with the resource bundle. To do this, select “Allow sharing to multiple service groups” and click “Business Group” to select all service groups Resource bundles are shared to multiple service groups. Operation method: Select “Allow sharing to multiple service groups”. Click “Business Group” to selects multiple service groups. The steps to create a resource bundle are as follows: 「Note」Please use the tenant administrator or infrastructure administrator to log in to the SmartCMP platform.

Network Resources Security Policy Group: Select one or more security policy groups Virtual Switch: If you choose a private network, you can choose a virtual switch. Click “Save” and the Aliyun resource bundle is created successfully. Define Business Group A business group is a logical organization structure within a tenant. SmartCMP supports the creation of a multi-level business group for the organization structure of the enterprise within the system. The business group associates the user to which the business group belongs and the resource bundles that the business group can use. A business group is a logical concept. Entities that need to associate users, service catalogs, and resource quotas can be associated with business groups, such as subsidiaries, departments at different levels, and so on. Default business group and tenant administrator, business group administrator, and business group members are created by default. Resource bundles can be assigned by the following steps: 「Note」If you need to modify the settings of this business group or create a new business group, please refer to the detailed steps in Organization Click “Organization” - “Business Groups” and click the business group name (Default) to enter the editing page Overview page, keep the default value User page: keep the default value. By default, two users are set up as business group administrators and business group member. Resource Bundles: click Add, select the vSphere resource bundle and OpenStack resource bundle created in the previous section, and click OK. Click Save to associate the business group with the resource bundle. Apply for resource and service association approval process for the business group, set naming rules and request specification. Configure cloud resource operations entitlement and service deployment operations entitlement for business group members Configure resources and budget quotas for business group members Define Virtual Machine Template The platform supports the creation of virtual machine templates. One operating system can correspond to multiple virtual machine templates, and one virtual machine template can be used in multiple cloud platforms. The virtual machine template is associated with a template in the vSphere platform or an image in the OpenStack platform. The installation mode and account information of the two SmartCMP agents can be configured in the VM template. The two agents are monitoring agents and automation agents. Some automation features in the SmartCMP platform rely on automated agents. For example: blueprint with application deployment or disk addition, service configuration initialization with disk mounted and new users created and some virtual machine operations (including reset password, execute script, application start & stop, add and extend Linux logical volume or Windows Disk, etc.). Once a virtual machine template is created, it can be specified directly in the service configuration. SmartCMP automatically recognizes virtual machine templates based on the cloud platform on which the blueprint objects are located. Here defines two virtual machine templates: CentOS 7 and Windows 2012 R2. 「Note」Please use the tenant administrator or infrastructure administrator to log in to SmartCMP. Tenant administrators can assign an infrastructure administrator role to a user. By default, three virtual machine templates are created: Windows 2012 R2, Redhat 7, and CentOS 7. You need to add the corresponding cloud platform information to use. Add a Linux VM Template Add a Linux VM Template Select Infrastructure - VM Templates to enter the VM template list interface.

The underlying infrastructure and network environment of the enterprise are more complex and the distributed architecture adopted by SmartCMP can adapt to various scenarios, such as: multiple data centers; multiple VPCs, isolation of virtual network environment; hybrid cloud, including private cloud (data center) + public cloud. By opening a limited communication port between CloudGateway and the master node, SmartCMP can use the cloud platform gateway to manage and monitor the resources of each VPC, data center or remote site in a unified manner. Typical application scenario Typical application scenario of the cloud platform gateway is the network isolation problem when the gateway cannot support the complete SaaS mode, which leads to the disconnection of SmartCMP and the isolated data center network. For example, as shown in the following figure: SmartCMP is connected to the main data center network but not connected to the isolated center network. We need to use the network segment of the main data center to access the isolated data center. By installing a virtual machine with Gateway in the main data center, after the Gateway is successfully deployed, add proxy gateway to center's cloud platform to connect SmartCMP to the isolated data center. The Role of Cloud Gateways After the cloud gateway is installed: Forward the request of the cloud resources in the isolated data center that the platform manages. For example, the cloud platform can send \"install automation agent\", \"install monitoring agent\", \"execute script\", \"install software\" and other requests to the corresponding cloud resources through CloudGateway, without directly connecting to each cloud resource under the isolated network. Help the cloud platform to obtain monitoring data of cloud resources in the isolated data center. For example, the cloud platform can obtain monitoring data from cloud resources that have installed monitoring agents through CloudGateway, without directly connecting to every cloud resource under the isolated network. Responsible for forwarding requests that cloud platform manages. Through CloudGateway, cloud resource life cycle management requests and resource status information acquisition requests are proxied to the cloud platform without directly connecting to the cloud platform. How to Install Cloud Gateway Multiple Installation Methods The cloud platform provides multiple installation methods for software architects to choose according to their needs: In the blueprint design, add CloudGateway software components to an instance, apply for a service, and after the instance is deployed, the installation and configuration of CloudGateway will be automatically completed. Dynamically add CloudGateway components to an instance node when applying for a service. After the instance is deployed, the installation and configuration of CloudGateway will be automatically completed. Import an existing instance, install the automation agent, and then install CloudGateway software components. After an instance has been deployed, after installing the automation agent, install CloudGateway software components through the operation interface of the instance. Installation Notes Notes for software architects when installing CloudGateway cloud gateway components: Operating system requirements: CentOS7.x/RHEL7.x. System requirements: CPU 4 cores, memory 16GB, disk 100GB (if the number of instances to be monitored is greater than 500, it should be appropriately increased). The instance where CloudGateway is installed needs to have SSH service access permissions, and an SSH access user with sudo permissions is needed. The instance needs to install an automation agent, and the installation process relies on the automation agent to execute the installation script. Specific Configuration Steps Take the first installation method as an example (\"Add CloudGateway software components to an instance in the blueprint design, apply for a service, and the instance will automatically complete the installation and configuration of CloudGateway\") to introduce the configuration in detail step: First of all, SmartCMP has built-in CloudGateway component in the component library. This component provides Nginx, Consul, Prometheus and other functions. Each Gateway component can only reverse the address of one cloud platform and monitor the API port of the cloud platform. Blueprint designer can organize CloudGateway, virtual machine, and network in the blueprint visual editor, as shown in the following figure: two network components, one of which is the management network to ensure the connection between Gateway and CMP, and the other is a proxy network to ensure the connection between Gateway and data center. In the service configuration, set the relevant parameters of the cloud platform gateway, including: the download path (the download path of the Ansible installation package of CloudGateway), cloud platform management address (isolated data center cloud platform address, 192.XX .XX.33), the proxy network segment (the network segment 192.XX.XX.1 and port 8989 of the network that the cloud platform can connect to CloudGateway) and whether to enable the cloud platform proxy (whether to enable CloudGateway to have this function, that is, cloud Resource life cycle management requests and resource status information acquisition requests are proxied to the cloud platform without directly connecting to the cloud platform). After the configuration is completed, publish to the service catalog for self-service. After the instance deployment is completed, the installation and configuration of CloudGateway will be automatically completed. After the installation is successful, the component will appear in the cloud resource software list and the menu list of \"Infrastructure\"-\"Cloud Gateways\" (only tenant administrators and IaaS administrators have permission to view), you can view the list to get the CloudGateway name , IP address, and creation time. At the same time, in the service deployment, you can view the information of the successfully deployed cloudvgateways, and perform changes and operations such as refreshing status, stopping, installing software, and deleting. When the cloud platform gateway is installed in the data center of the isolated network, the administrator needs to go to the \"Infrastructure\"-\"Cloud Entries\"-the cloud platform of the isolated data center (for example, the cloud platform of the isolated data center mentioned above, 192.XX.XX.33), associate CloudGateway, enter the gateway information (leave blank by default, this information matches the gateway information configured in the service configuration, such as: gateway port 8989 is consistent).

The administrator allocates the resource bundle to the business group to implement the segmentation of the cloud platform resources. You can specify the resource bundle to use the specific resources of the target cloud platform. For example, you can customize the resource bundle to associate the storage resource and network resource with the development resource bundle. Through the resource bundle, specify the resource quotas that can be used, such as the total number of virtual machines allowed to be deployed, the total amount of vCPUs allowed, the total amount of memory, and so on. Add a Resource Bundle After the cloud platform is successfully added, the cloud platform resources are divided into one or more resource bundles, and the corresponding resource quotas are allocated to different business groups. The relationship between resource bundles and business groups is divided into three types: Resource bundle is only assigned to a unique business group Resource bundle is assigned to all business groups, and the newly added business group automatically associates the resource bundle Resource bundles are shared to multiple business groups Support resource bundle replication. Usage scenarios: When an administrator configures multiple clusters for vCenter, each business group needs to configure these clusters as resource bundles, allowing administrators to quickly create resource bundles with the same or similar configuration. Specific operation steps: In the left navigation, select \"Infrastructure\" and select \"Resource Bundle Management\". In the list of resource bundles, select a resource bundle and click the copy button (When multiple resource bundles are selected, the copy button will not work.) to generate a new resource bundle creation page.

All configurations are the same as the original resource bundle. The administrator can modify the related parameters of the original resource bundle, including the assigned business group and the sharing mode. Support resource bundle enable or disable. When the administrator is creating and editing a resource bundle, a selection button is added below the priority to enable the resource bundle, which is selected by default. Resource bundles, whether enabled or disabled, can be assigned to business groups. After disabling, when deploying cloud resources, the selection of this resource bundle is not supported, but the existing resources are not affected in any way.

A template is a virtual machine encapsulated in a file, and a new VM can be quickly deployed through the template. Each template contains installation metadata, which is the setup information required to create a new instance with a specific operating system, optimal storage, CPU, memory, and virtual network configuration. The platform supports the creation of virtual machine templates. One operating system can correspond to multiple virtual machine templates. A virtual machine template is associated with a template or image in the cloud platform, such as templates in vSphere vCenter, images on the OpenStack platform and operating system (OS) images for each area of the public cloud platform. The installation mode and account information of the two SmartCMP agents can be configured in the VM template. The two agents are monitoring agents and automation agents. Some of the automation features of SmartCMP rely on automation agents such as: Blueprint with application deployment or adding disks Service configuration initializes and mounts disks, creating new users Part of virtual machine operations (including resetting passwords, executing scripts, stopping applications, adding, expanding Linux logical volumes or Windows disks, etc.). Once a virtual machine template is created, it can be specified directly in the service configuration. SmartCMP automatically recognizes virtual machine templates based on the cloud platform on which the blueprint objects are located. 「Note」Please use the tenant administrator or infrastructure administrator account to log in to SmartCMP platform. Tenant administrators can assign an infrastructure administrator role to a user. By default, three virtual machine templates are created: Windows 2012 R2, Redhat 7, and CentOS 7.

Configure Resource Tags Specific steps for adding tags: Click \"Infrastructure\"-\"Resource tags\", the administrator has the authority to configure tags and define the parameters of the tags. Configure the \"Basic Information\" of the resource tag: name (generally configured in Chinese, such as 环境), primary key (only letters and numbers, such as env, as the identification bit), description, order (defines the order of tag selection) , selection type ( Single-selection / multiple-selection, specify how tags select value sets when performing filtering), specified resource types: cloud resources (for example: resource bundle), storage resources (for example: vSphere data storage, OpenStack storage type), network resources. 「Note」You can set multiple tags for the same resource bundle. For example, you can choose different tags for storage or network resources in the same vSphere resource bundle. Configure the \"value set\" of the resource tag. For example, when the key is an environment and supports creation of a value, it supports adding a value set (for example, production environment), and it also supports adding multiple value sets (for example, production environment, test environment and development environment) and each value needs to be configured with a name, a primary key (which can be used for naming rules), and a description. Click the Save button and the resource tag is created. Use Resource Tags After the resource label is created, bind the resource bundle to the resource label. Specific operation steps: Click \"Infrastructure\"-\"Resource Bundles\" on the left navigation bar and select \"Key Value\" in the resource label. A resource bundle can only select one key but one or more values. for example: vSphere resource bundle, key is selected as \"environment\", select a value \"development environment\" or multiple values \"production environment, test environment, development environment\". Scenarios of resource tags in service configuration: Configure the resource bundle of Server or Instance node. The available resource bundles are derived from the \"shared resource bundle or the resource bundle bound to the business group\". Use resource tags to quickly locate the required resource bundles. Select a strategy for manually specifying a resource bundle, and then filter based on the selected resource tags, and then select based on the results of the tag filtering and choose whether to allow modification during request or approval. For example: configuration of vSphere Cloud Service Server component. Select the strategy for manually specifying the resource bundle, select the resource bundle \"vSphere Development \" with the \"Development Environment\" resource tag, and check \"Allow modification\" and \"Change only during approval\". After the service configuration is completed, when the service is applied, the resource bundle can be selected again. In the scenario of \"multiple keys and each key has multiple values\". For example, there are two keys, \"Environment, Performance\". When the key is the environment, there are three values below, which are \"Pro, UAT, Dev\"; when the key is performance, the three values below are \"high performance, medium performance, and general performance\". There are two resource bundles (vSphere-dev resource bundle and vSphere-test resource bundle). The vSphere-dev resource bundle has 2 tags Pro and high performance, and the vSphere-test resource bundle has 2 tags UAT and general performance. When configuring the display of cloud resources and service request pages, only Pro and UAT are displayed under \"Environment\", and only high performance and general performance are displayed under \"Performance\". After selecting one of the resource tag values arbitrarily, the remaining tag display must be dynamically adjusted based on the selection of the value of the first resource tag. For example: first select the value “Pro” of the resource label, and the remaining second label will only show “high performance”. By analogy, in application scenarios with more keys and more values, the selection logic is also consistent. 「Note」 Select the resource bundle selection policy of \"Automatically select the one with largest remaining capacity, lowest cost or evenly allocate\". The platform will automatically allocate according to the policy, and when it is automatically allocated, you can only choose among the resource bundles filtered by tags. For more service configuration information, please refer to: Service Configuration Configure resource bundles in the service configuration to allow modification. On the application page, for each key, according to the resource tags configured in the resource bundle, only the values already used in the resource bundle are displayed.

SmartCMP supports the creation of a multi-level business group for the organization structure of the enterprise within the system. The business group associates the user to which the business group belongs and the resource bundles that the business group can use. A business group is a logical concept. Entities that need to associate users, service catalogs, and resource quotas can be associated with business groups, such as subsidiaries, departments at different levels, and so on. Default business group and tenant administrator, business group administrator, and business group members are created by default. A business group can create one or more projects. The user members in the project can only be derived from the members of the business group where the project is located and can access each other's virtual machines created by the project members.

Once configured, the default template configuration will be overwritten. Resource Quota Business group resource quota meets the needs of controlling department-level resource quotas. The budget quota of the business group is independent of the resource quota of the resource bundle. When the budget of the business group reaches the threshold and there is a large amount of resource quota remaining in the resource bundle, business group members cannot request new resources in the service catalog. Note: The resource quota can be configured with a larger amount than the business group budget. Specifically, the following resources can be set: CPU, memory, storage, and number of virtual machines. Note: First, you must enable \"Enable resource quota\". Disabled by default: The resource quota interface prohibits input and does not calculate the amount of resources used Enabled: The above resources can set quotas. They are all non-required items. Only integers greater than or equal to zero can be entered. Leave blank to indicate no limit. Supports viewing of used quotas. (If a certain quota is unlimited, then the remaining is always unlimited. The usage rate is always 0%.) When new service deployment occupies resources, operations modify the configuration, or the resource usage or the business group gets changed, the corresponding resource usage will change. 「Note」If the business group has not enabled quotas, but the business group has resources occupied, after the quota is enabled, the business group needs to be able to display the resources that have been used. Quotas for child business groups are temporarily independent, that is, they are not restricted by the parent business group and can be configured separately. Budget Quota The administrator can configure a monthly budget for this business group, leaving it blank for unlimited. 「Note」Personal budget cannot be greater than the total budget of the business group. When the spending of this month exceeds the budget, users will not be able to request new cloud resources, and paid instances belonging to users will be shut down. Supports control of resources and resource requests based on configured policies. You can view the real-time usage rate, resource usage, and remaining amount of cloud resources of the business group on this page. Specific steps: Select year or month as the time unit. Select monthly to indicate that it is cleared on the 1st of each month and restore the initial value; select annual to indicate that the zero has been cleared on the beginning of the next year and restore the initial value. Business group quota management: Fill in the total budget. Set the percentage. When the overall cost of the business group exceeds the configured total budget percentage, subsequent notifications are triggered, and the system will automatically send a notification to the business group administrator. User quota management: Set personal budget and percentage. When personal budget usage reaches the threshold, trigger subsequent notifications and send notifications to users. Budget strategy: Select \"Cannot request new resources after the budget is used up\". When the business group budget is used up, all users associated with the business group will not be able to request new resources that require payment. Select \"Paid resources will be automatically shut down after the budget is used up\". For example: Configure vSphere billing rules. Deploy vSphere instances. Configure business group billing and personal budgets. Configure \"Shutdown after budgets are used up\", and when personal budgets are used up, the instances belonging to the individual will be shut down, or when the business group budget is used up, those belonging to the business group will be shut down. After shutdown, reservation will be made according to the retention time of the business group and after the retention time expires, the resources will be put into the recycle bin. 「Note」When there are multiple users with different quotas in the business group, one user owing money does not affect other users' requests for resources. The instances belonging to that user are shut down which does not affect the status of other users'. Personal budget renewal: Submit the renewal ticket.

SmartCMP provides a rich set of out-of-the-box software components that visualize blueprints, provide custom forms, and define parameters and fields for any service. Flexible configuration of resources for each service meets the diverse needs of users. At the same time SmartCMP provides a built-in process designer, allowing users to design service processes and approval processes in a visually drag-and-drop manner, helping users to complete process strategy design accurately and quickly. The administrator groups the services through the service catalog to publish the IT products and services required by the enterprise or organization and provides the users with self-service requests. Service modeling configures resources, parameters, automated workflows, and approval policies for each service for automated deployment. The following diagram describes the whole process of how to assemble components, build blueprints, configure service, group service, and publish. Software architects combine software components and infrastructure components to build a blueprint for cloud services. Administrators configure resources and parameters for services. IT support administrators define processes and specify service teams to group and publish services to service catalogs. The business group members apply for self-service in the service catalog according to actual needs.

It not only has rich component resources and common operations built in, but also has a highly scalable capability. It can flexibly customize component resources and configure operations. The definition of components adopts an object-oriented design method, uses a unified data structure for modeling, and standardizes configuration properties. Software architects can also create reusable software components as needed and use operation scripts to accurately specify the deployment operation process. Platform supports rewriting these operation scripts at any time, releases them in real time, and synchronously updates installed software components. By defining attributes and passing attributes as parameters to action scripts, software components can be deployed in different environments without modifying the script. Support to use Ansible, Terraform, Shell, Python, Json, Ruby and other languages to customize software components, and customize the life cycle operations of software components (including creation, configuration, start, stop, delete, backup, inspection, etc.). System has built-in create, configure and start operations, call stop and delete operations when removed, and support flexible custom operations to achieve full lifecycle management of software and applications. Components in SmartCMP consist of attributes and interfaces. Software components are composed of scripts, attributes, metadata, and lifecycle management. Flexible software components can be associated with mainstream product libraries. The specific concepts are as follows: Script: Each phase of the lifecycle is controlled by scripts. Thanks to the powerful underlying class library, SmartCMP supports languages such as Shell, Powershell, Ruby, Python, etc., which can quickly integrate application deployment into the cloud management platform. Attributes: Different application systems have custom requirements for resource requirements and capacity control. Attribute items can pass custom parameters according to different system deployment requirements. The software architect can expose the configuration parameters that the application component needs to fill out to the request interface by setting the custom attribute. The SmartCMP cloud management platform will automatically invoke the relevant parameters to execute the installation configuration of the application Metadata: Metadata contains properties of the application component itself, including application component versions, related descriptions, regular inheritance relationships, and dependent system types Lifecycle Management: SmartCMP cloud management platform provides complete lifecycle management of creation, configuration, start, stop, and removal of applications. All software configuration from deployment to expiration uninstallation is done through script correspondence Software components are associated with the mainstream product library, supporting the docking of Jfrog Artifactory, the Nexus product library, and implementing software version updates. Software architects can manage components through the component management interface. In the navigation on the left, choose Service Design - SW Components. A list of all components appears in the right navigation area. Rich Component Library Out-of-the-box component resources. SmartCMP cloud management platform has a large number of commonly-used component resources, including IaaS (cloud hosts, networks, storage, etc. for different cloud platforms), PaaS (servers, databases, RDS, etc.), containers (Kubernetes , Docker), software (MySQL, Oracle, Nginx, etc.), agents (monitoring agents, automation agents). Different types of resources are created and managed in a unified interface, using a tree-like grouping catalog, supporting custom component grouping, secondary editing, quick copy, importing, and exporting components. Tree Grouping Catalog Supports a grouped catalog of components and a tree structure. You can search for tree displays in creating components page and component lists. The tree structure on the component list page can be added, deleted, and modified. Existing component catalogs cannot be deleted. The tree structure is a logical folder concept and has no binding relationship with the resource type of the component. The tree structure allows users to adjust. For example, some users have a cloud platform at the first level, and computing, storage, and network components under the cloud platform at the second level; and some users have computing, network, and storage at the first level, and each has a second level. cloud platform. Details: IaaS is used to describe all IaaS components. Each component has its own cloud platform type. The secondary nodes under IaaS mainly include computing, network, storage, object storage, load balancing, security group, file system, etc. The following subdirectories are added by default. Cloud hostStorageOSS: Object storageDisk: Block storageNAS Network: NetworkSubnet: SubnetRouter: Routing SecurityGroup: Security groupFirewallLoad balancingLoad balancing listenerFloating IPDomain nameGateway PaaS is used to describe all PaaS components. Each component has its own cloud platform type. The secondary nodes under PaaS mainly include the service capabilities provided by the cloud platform. By default, the following subdirectories are added. WebAPPMQCache: cacheRDSNoSQLBigData : Big Data Services Container is used to describe all the components of the container platform.DockerKubernetes Software component is used to describe all software components. Each component has its own cloud platform type. The software is divided into two types, one is binary installed software that runs inside the machine, and the other is container image software running in the container. The container image component can be distinguished by type, and an attribute resource.software is added to mark whether the software is running in the machine or the container. The following subdirectories are added by default: WebAPPMQCache: CacheRDSNoSQLBigData: Big Data Service Agent, which means all agent components, including automation components, monitoring components, etc., for subsequent agent management. Monitoring agents and automation agents 「Note」 Monitoring component: If you need to use cloud platform monitoring to view cloud server indicator data and generate alerts, you need to properly install the monitoring component on the cloud server. Cloud server indicator data collection depends on the monitoring component. Edit component Select a component in the component list to enter the edit component view. Editing a component is similar to creating a component. In order to ensure that the blueprints created using this component will not be unusable due to component updates, during editing, there are some items in each sub view of the component that are not allowed to change. Click the \"Back\" button at any time during the process of editing the component to abandon editing the component. Import and export components You can import components according to the following steps: Select \"Service Design\"-\"Component Library\" Click the \"Import\" Click \"Browse\", select the local component (ZIP format), and click \"Submit\" The component is imported successfully You can export components according to the following steps: Select \"Service Design\"-\"Component Library\" Select a component in the component list, the \"Export\" button on the menu bar will become available, click \"Export\" The component is exported successfully Copy / delete components You can follow these steps to copy components: Select \"Service Design\"-\"Component Library\" Select a component in the component list, the \"Copy\" button on the menu bar will become available, click \"Copy\" Enter the editing page of the replication component to change the basic information, attributes, script list, and node interface information. The component name needs to be modified as the component does not allow duplicate names You can remove components according to the following steps: In the component list view, select the component to be deleted After clicking the \"Delete\" button in the list toolbar, confirm in the confirmation dialog box and the component will be deleted Create Components Users can create reusable components according to their needs, componentize any resource, and standardize the process of configuring components, including defining resource types, versions, attributes, component operations, etc., and all configuration interfaces are open to user customization. For example, when a DBA creates a database cluster and an Oracle database needs to be deployed, DBA can add Oracle components to the component library and configure components according to requirements, including configuring component profiles, instructions, properties, scripts, and operations (create, start, stop, restart, delete, etc. the specified database) Support software architects to customize software components. Specific steps for adding components: Click the \"Add\" button to enter the create component view. The create component view contains \"Basic Information\", \"Attributes\", \"Script List\", \"Operations\", \"History Version\", and \"Artifacts\". Component Overview In the \"Basic Information\" view, define the component name, description, component version, component type (define the resource type of the component and determine the properties and operations of the component. For example, when you select the component type as Software when adding an Oracle component, the newly created Oracle component will be Inherit the properties and operations of the software component of the parent class. You can also customize the properties to obtain different functions from the parent class.), cloud platform information and upload icon. You can also add a description of the component. After selecting Artifact, you can select the binary software artifact library on the \" Artifacts\" tab to configure the software version. For specific steps, refer to associating mainstream artifact libraries. Check Instantiate. After checking, the component can be arranged by Blueprint Design. In the left navigation, select \"Service Design\"-\"Blueprint Design\", and a list of all components appears in the right navigation area. Component Attributes Attributes: It is used to meet the specific requirements of resource deployment and parameter control of different systems. It is composed of primary key, type, default value, alternatives and description. You can add optional values to the alternatives, so that when you apply for service, you can only choose from the values defined in the default and alternatives. You can create software attributes that require the use of characters, floating point numbers, passwords, Booleans, or integer values. Support for setting validation rules. Enter regular expressions and the attribute parameter must pass the validation of the expression. (Example: Integer type: Use integer attribute types for zero and positive or negative integers. Boolean type: Use Boolean attribute types to provide True and False options in the Value drop-down menu.) In the Properties view, add the properties of the component. After the addition is complete, you can pass them as parameters to the operation script. For example, when the component Oracle is created, different application systems have specific requirements and custom requirements for Oracle's deployment requirements and parameter control. \"Attributes\" can be set according to the deployment requirements of different systems, by setting custom attributes, exposing configuration parameters that application components need to fill out to the interface configuration, and passing custom parameters. When Oracle is deployed automatically, the SmartCMP cloud management platform automatically invokes relevant parameters to perform application installation and configuration, which meets different requirements for Oracle deployment in different data clusters. Script List Scripts: Each stage of the component life cycle is controlled by scripts. Thanks to the powerful underlying class libraries, it supports customizable scripts including Ansible, Terraform, Shell, Python and other methods. In the \"Script \" view, you can add a script file by creating a new file. These script files should be associated with an operation in the component interface or referenced by other script files. At the same time, you can add text files, which are typically used to provide configuration information for the component. Multiple clicks to create a new file can add multiple files. After entering the file name and file type, click Action-Edit Content. You can write the file content on the right. Actions Action: You can perform complete life cycle management on the application system creation, configuration, start, stop, and delete processes. Through script correspondence, complete all software configuration work from installation and deployment to uninstallation after expiration. In the \"Action\" view, you can associate the script file added in the \"Script List\" view to the corresponding operation of the component, which is implemented under each operation action-please select the script file corresponding to this operation from the drop-down list. Built-in actions include configuration, creation, delete, start, stop, and more. Take the refresh operation as an example, the operation is configured in system in advance, and the implementation methods, scripts, tasks, and parameters necessary for the operation are used. The built-in operation can be applied to any resource on the platform. Therefore, when the component Oracle is created, the built-in \"start, stop, restart, delete, refresh\" operations are automatically inherited. Encapsulation hides the implementation details of complex operations and only provides public access to the outside world. The platform has complex operations built-in and works out of the box, reducing differences and difficulty in understanding. For example: \"adjust virtual machine configuration\" operation (adjust virtual machine calculation specifications and cloud platform specifications), when the cloud platform type is different, the SmartCMP cloud management platform hides the details of the flow of resource operations, only exposing public access interfaces. For example, the \"Adjust virtual machine configuration\" operation is applied to a virtual machine on the Hyper-V platform and a virtual machine on the OpenStack platform. The specific technical implementation is different, but the user configuration interface displays the same content. At the same time, you can also add more component actions here and associate the corresponding script files. Click the Add button. After all required fields are added, click the Save button to generate a new component. You can see the newly added component on the component list. Click the \"Back\" button at any time during the process of adding components to discard adding components. Life cycle action Description Example Create Create Software Create a Tomcat service, and scripts written for the Create lifecycle operation will run when the software is first installed. Configuration Configurate software Configure Tomcat and set JAVA_OPTS and CATALINA_OPTS. The configuration script runs after the installation operation is complete. Start Start software Use the startup command in the Tomcat server to start the Tomcat service. The startup script runs after the configuration operation is complete. Stop Stop software Use the stop command in the Tomcat server to stop the Tomcat service. The stop script runs after the start operation is complete. Delete Delete software Perform specific actions in the application before destroying the deployment. The delete script runs after the software component is destroyed. Configuration Action While a large number of common actions are built in, system supports the operation of custom components, and the configuration interface is open to users, including the implementation of custom actions (supporting scripts / tasks); scripts (scripts come from custom script files); filter conditions, the components action supports the filter condition of EL expression. When the expression is customized, the action can be displayed in the action list only when the filter condition is satisfied. After the display becomes effective, it can be selected for execution. Otherwise, the action will not be displayed in the action list. The format of the expression, for example: $ {param}, $ {param> 1}, $ {param == 'abc'}, $ {param! = Null}, $ {param == null}, when you fill in the expression $ {componentType! = 'resource.iaas.instance.vSphere'} indicating that the component type needs to be a virtual machine of the vSphere cloud platform, and the customized action can take effect on the component resources that \"fulfill the above conditions\", that is, it will be displayed in the \" vSphere cloud platform virtual machine action list \"and support the corresponding operations. Action grouping (actions are grouped, for example: start, stop, suspend, restart, etc. under common actions; change setting labels, adjust virtual machine configuration, update cloud host name, etc. under configuration actions) And the specific parameter configuration (timeout time and maximum number of retries) performed. For example: add a backup operation to the IaaS cloud host resource (the Linux virtual machine of the vSphere cloud platform). Customize the basic information of the operation. Customize the \"backup script backup.sh\" in the script list. When configuring the operation, select the script backup.sh, bind the script to the operation, and select the operation mode as \"Shell\". 「Note」The Linux virtual machine of the vSphere cloud platform. The added operations are supported on the \"Deployments\"-\"Instance\" page. For details, please refer to: Cloud Resource Operation Entitlement Software component form configuration: In the software component, parameters and forms can be configured for the \"create\" action and other custom actions, where the form is dynamically generated based on attributes. The content of the completed form is configured (supports JSON format), and the preview of the form can also be displayed directly to meet various needs. Support for secondary update operation. The system has provided the implementation of this operation. If you need to override, you can enable the option \"Override system action\". In the \"Action\" view, click any action to enter the basic information tab page. When the selected primary key name matches the existing built-in action of the system, the option and prompt to overwrite the operating system will appear. Select \"Overwrite system action\" and later information such as implementation configuration, execution configuration, and form configuration will appear. Dependencies Some component resources cannot be deployed separately. For example, software components need to be deployed in conjunction with other component resources to support the creation and management of dependencies between the current component and other components. Dependencies are used to define the different sequence of multiple components in the scenario of simultaneous orchestration and deployment, and runtime parameters can be passed between components that have dependencies. In the \"Dependencies\" view: Select the type (included / dependent), and then select the target component. For example, in the vSphere cloud platform, the MySQL component and Serve component are included, and the Serve component and Network component are dependent. Version Management When you update the component, each updated version will be recorded and supported to fall back to the historical version. The specific steps are as follows: Click the \"Any component\" button on the toolbar of the component list to enter the software component view In the “History Version” view, you can see all the historical versions. When you make changes, the platform will record your historical version information by default: version number, version description, creator and creation time. You can check the corresponding version v1, click “Restore Version” to return from the version v2 to the historical version v1, and click “Save and Synchronize” to synchronize the component information. At the same time, it also supports one-click to delete any historical version, check the version to be deleted, click “Delete” to confirm the deletion and delete successfully. Associate Mainstream Product Libraries Support software components’ association with mainstream product libraries, docking Jfrog Artifactory, Nexus product library matching package management platform and software version update. The version of the package management tool supports the latest tag, indicating that the latest version is used. In the Products view, you can select endpoints, warehouses (Jfrog Artifactory, Nexus), groups, names, versions Click the Save button to associate the component with the package management platform.

The system provides standard workflows by default and supports administrators to define the processes required for flexible services through the workflow designer, control cloud application, operations, and recycle, and manage and close manual ticket services. There are three main types of workflows for the platform: approval, manual ticket service, and cloud resource blueprint service process. Approval Workflow Management Support tenant administrators to customize the approval workflow template through the workflow designer. The specific configuration of the customization includes the approval hierarchy, the approval of the approver, the approval rules, and the operations that can be performed. Main function point: Support for defining any multi-level approvals. Support the entire workflow of graphical design approval in Workflow Designer. Support for defining approval by user or role. Support for defining the configuration of the request when defining an approval. Support for defining requirements for approval and notification at the business group and service catalog level. Support for approver batch operation approval. Support for setting fields that can be modified by each level of approver. Configure Workflow There are two ways to configure the SmartCMP configuration workflow: First, the business group administrator or tenant administrator adds the approval workflow A to the business group configuration. Second, the business group administrator or tenant administrator adds the approval workflow B to the service configuration. When the two configuration methods are used at the same time, the approval workflow conflicts. The approval workflow B in the service configuration takes precedence over the approval workflow A in the business group configuration. Add a Workflow to a Business Group You can add an approval workflow to a business group. After the configuration is successful, when a business group member applies for service deployment, it needs to be controlled through the workflow in the approval template. \"Organization\" - \"Business Group\", click the business group name to enter the business group details page On the Approval Workflow tab, select the approval template and click Save After saving, the members of the business group will enter the approval workflow when applying for services Add a Workflow in Service Configuration After the service catalog is successfully applied, if the service is configured with the approval workflow in advance, the service will enter the approval queue and obtain the approval comments of the relevant members in the approval template. Deployment can be performed only after the approval is passed. Example: Select a service such as \"vSphere single-node service\" and add an approval workflow for the service in the service configuration Service Design - Catalog Config, select vSphere Single Node Service in the Service Configuration List. Click the service name to enter the Edit Service page. On the Approval Configuration page, select the approval workflow (the service configuration workflow. The content of the approval workflow can only be viewed and selected and cannot be edited or deleted.) Click Save. After saving, the application for the service needs to be approved according to the approval workflow of the template before deployment. Service applicant clicks on the service catalog in the left navigation bar, selects “vSphere Single Node Service”, and clicks to enter the service application page. Fill in the application form: including the business group (when the card is shared to all business groups), the service deployment name (if the business group does not set the service deployment naming rules), the number of deployment, project, owner, deployment reason, virtual Machine template, etc., click \"Apply\" after filling out. Check the status of the application: enter the \"Request\" - \"Pending Approval\", the application status is in \"pending approval\" status. Approval: The approver specified in the approval template logs into the system and enters the \" Requests\" - \"Pending Approval\" to select the project to be approved. Enter the approval comments, click “Approve”, a confirmation prompt will pop up, click “Yes” View the approved projects: Enter \"Requests\" - \"Approved Request\", the status of the project is \"Approval\" After the applicant logs in to the system, go to \"My Requests\" and the blueprint deployment status of the application changes to \"Approved\". In Service Deployment, the project has begun deployment. After the deployment is successful, in Service Deployment, select the service to allow the service to be operated. Custom Parallel Approval Workflow In the left navigation bar, click \"Service Design\" - \"Workflow\", click on the Add Name (Parallel Approval Workflow), Description, Category (Approval Workflow) and other information, then use the Workflow Designer to design and define the approvals workflow you need to enable. Select the parallel approval workflow and go to the Workflow Designer to customize the specific strategy graphically: Introduce the use of the workflow designer: the left circle represents the starting node, the right circle represents the ending node, and the parallel approval workflow sets two parallel approval links (approval A link, approval B link). If a request passes through the A link and passes The B link, it is successful. If any of the two links fails, the request fails. As the picture shows: Approvers can choose roles Approvers can choose roles. For example, a tenant administrator, a business group administrator, etc., can also designate a user as an approver. Built-in role usage in the approval workflow:In order to satisfy the approval workflow, we need to add an additional approval role to the approval workflow if we want approval to start with the applicant's lowest-level organizational structure and then the business group where the resource is located. When the administrator edits the approval workflow, the approver selects \"role\" and lists the built-in approval roles: \"Primary Business Group Administrator\": defined as the administrator of the lowest-level business group where the user is located \"Secondary business group administrator\": defined as the administrator of the upper-level business group where the user is located. A two-level approval workflow is added to the approval workflow. The first-level role selects the “first-level business group administrator” and the second-level role selects the “second-level business group administrator”. Approval can be initiated from the lowest organizational structure of the business group where the applicant resources are located. The approver selects the dynamic user, specifies the “dynamic user” ${FORM.approver}, customizes the form for the service, and binds the approver field at the form configuration, so that you can specify any user as the approver's needs. Approvers’ choices are based on access rights and when this workflow is used for deployment or cloud resource operational approval, only users with read access to the resource can receive approval requests. Approval changes (allow or do not allow the approver to modify) Advanced configuration (configurable specific fields that the approver can modify, such as CPU, memory, etc.) There are two types of approval rules:The first type is a fixed value, that is, if the number of approvers meets the set number, then the approval passes, and if one person refuses to pass, the approval fails. The second type is the percentage of approve members meets the set percentage. If one person rejects, the approval fails. The specific operations are divided into approval operations and execution operations: The approval operation is the authority given to the level approver to approve, reject or return the application. There is no approval permission for execution operations. It cannot reject or return but only check the application content and confirm the approval as the reviewer. In addition, you can also define whether the layer approver has the right to modify the application. If necessary, please check “allow modification to the application”. Built-in approval workflow The system has built-in tenant administrator approval workflow, business group administrator approval workflow, and approval template workflow, which is convenient for users to directly select the required approval workflow. The built-in approval workflow cannot be modified or deleted. It only supports viewing and use. The user-defined add-on approval workflow supports modification and deletion. Tenant Administrator Approval: Defined as an administrator within the tenant system where the user is located Business Group Administrator Approval: Defined as the administrator of the business group in which the user is located Approval Template Workflow: Built-in Cloud Service Deployment Approval Workflow Ticket Service Workflow Management The manual ticket service workflow defines the specific processing steps, service teams, service personnel, and transfer methods of the ticket tasks. After the service group is established, the ticket is created through the service configuration, and the ticket is published to the service catalog to complete the release of the service card and the management of the service catalog. The following sections will detail the steps to configure the manual ticket service process, configure the manual ticket service, and publish the manual ticket service. Custom Add Manual Ticket Service Process In the left navigation bar, click \"Service Design\" - \"Workflow\", click Add, enter the name (manual ticket service process), description, select category (manual ticket service), upload process configuration file. Built-in manual Ticket service process The manual ticket service process built into the platform includes standard manual tickets, standard event management processes, and automated service processes. Standard event management process to solve problems related to IT resources, such as: unexpected server shutdown, network interruption, etc., network IP address conflicts, and so on. The process type belongs to the manual ticket service. Standard manual tickets: Services that require IT manual intervention, such as manual ticket services that require a password reset. Automated service process: The user applies for the manual ticket service. After the service is approved, the user can automatically create the resources requested, for example, create a project, create an IP pool, and so on. 「Note」The manual ticket service process built in does not support modification and deletion. It only supports viewing and use. The manual ticket service process added by the user supports modification and deletion. Incident The standard event workflow Incident Report is used to solve problems related to IT resources, such as server down, network IP address conflicts, and so on. The workflow type belongs to the manual ticket service. The specific process is as follows: The main aspects of the standard event workflow include: first-line processing support, second-line processing support, and shutdown services. The first- and second-line task processing links can be assigned to different teams. After the first-line processing supports receiving the event, the operations that can be performed are as follows: Direct processing, after the problem is solved, fill in the cause or the description of the problem or the solution Transfer to other business groups Upgrade: Upgrade to the second line for processing and fill in the upgrade instructions After the second-line support process receives the event, the operations that can be performed are as follows: Direct processing, after the problem is solved, you can fill in the reason for the problem and the explanation of the solution Transfer to other teams The email notifies the user that the problem has been solved. After the user who initiated the manual ticket service application receives the problem-solving email, the user performs the service shutdown operation, and the ticket status changes to “processed”; if the user chooses to re-process the ticket , then return to the handler of the previous level. (When the email informs the user in the previous step, whoever processed it is returned to whom, the second-line processing returns to the second line, and the first line returns to the first line), and the ticket status changes to \"Processing\". Cloud Resource Blueprint Service Workflow Built-in standard cloud service deployment workflow: Define the workflow of cloud resource automation deployment, which belongs to the cloud resource blueprint service workflow built into the system. To meet the service process requirements of different service items, the platform has built-in multiple service processes and custom added service processes. System administrators and tenant administrators can access the Configuration Management - Workflow page to add, view, workflow design, enable, disable, edit, and delete workflow templates. The following describes the specific steps. 「Note」: Built-in service workflow does not support editing, workflow design, enable, disable, delete operations Click \"Service Design\" - \"Workflow\" in the left navigation bar, click the \"Add\" button. Enter the new workflow page and enter the basic information of the custom process: workflow name, description, category (cloud resource blueprint service, manual ticket service and approval process). After saving the name, category and other information, you can use the workflow designer to design and define the processes you need to enable. Introduce the method of creating the basic flow chart: the left circle represents the starting node, the right circle represents the ending node, and the ticket task processing flow can be customized after the task 1, the custom task 2, or the rest of the custom task. as the picture shows: Click the Save button to create a custom service workflow. Standard Task Execution Built-in incident execution process: Define the process of automated task execution. Specific task types include: service provision tasks, cloud resource tasks, Jenkins tasks, script tasks, wait tasks, etc. Through service configuration, the specific type of service is configured, and the standard task execution process is bound. After the configuration is completed, it will be published to the service catalog, and a task can be executed directly by applying for a service. Edit and Delete Service Workflows In the left navigation bar, click \"Service Design\" - \"Workflow\" to select a workflow, click \"Edit\" - \"Workflow Design\" to directly enter the UI of the Service Workflow Designer, display the process of the workflow, and visually change the design workflow. 「Note」The workflow selected must be a custom added workflow, and the system built-in workflow does not support workflow design. In the left navigation bar, click \"Service Design\" - \"Workflow\", select a service workflow, click the \"Delete\" button, and the delete prompt box will pop up. Click \"Yes\" to prompt the deletion of the service workflow. 「Note」Deletion fails when the workflow definition is being used in a service configuration. Enable and Disable Service Workflows In the left navigation bar, click \"Service Design\" – “Workflow”, select a service workflow, click the \"Enable\" button to enable the service workflow. In the left navigation bar, click \"Service Design\" – “Workflow”, select a service workflow, and click the \"Disable\" button to disable the service workflow. 「Note」There are two main workflows for the system: standard cloud service deployment and standard manual tickets. These two built-in workflows are enabled by default and cannot be disabled, modified, or deleted. Copyright © 2016-2020 CloudChef. All Rights Reserved.

The agreement stipulates the time and other conditions for the completion of the service. User can associate service level agreements with services provided by the platform (for example: manual tickets, cloud resource deployment, and task execution) to ensure timely tracking of service processing. Application scenario: In the traditional resale mode, the SLA agreement is written into the contract and has someone to track it. In the new resale scenario, SmartCMP binds the SLA to the service. Service applicants and service providers can automatically track the entire process and view the service progress and the time spent in real time. Main functions: Tenant administrators can create one or more service level agreements, define service response time (two optional time units, days / hours), service agreement name, description, priority (highest, high, medium, Low), and users and roles notified by email. Service level agreements are created once and can be applied to different services repeatedly, but a service configuration can only be associated with one service level agreement. Define four SLA status: the remaining time accounts for 50% -100% of the response time, the status is normal; the remaining time accounts for 25% -50% of the response time, the status is warning; the remaining time accounts for the response time 0-25 %, the status is critical; and the remaining time is below 0, the status is overdue. For example, the tenant administrator sets the SLA response time to 4 hours. After the tenant member request service, if the remaining time for service processing is more than 2 hours, then the SLA status color is green; if the remaining time is within 1 hour and 2 hours the SLA status color is displayed in yellow; if the remaining time is within 0-1 hours, the color of the SLA status displays orange; and if it is overdue, the color of the SLA status displays red. When the SLA level changes, a notification will be sent to the role or user configured by the administrator in advance. Administrators can configure service level agreements for related services. They can be set as allowing changes when applying and published to the service catalog after the configuration is completed. When users request services through the service catalog, they can choose service level agreements as needed. If the administrator has configured a service level agreement for the service, and the service is configured with an approval process in which the SLA is not allowed to be modified on the approval page, when the approver rejects the service request and the applicant reapplies for the service, the remaining time is still calculated based on the previous request time. The following describes the configuration steps of the service level agreement. Add Service Level Agreement Tenant administrators have the authority to create, edit, and delete service level agreements. Tenant members only have the right to view. Tenant members with service configuration rights can associate service level agreements with services. Tenant administrators select \"Service Design\"-\"Service Level Agreement\" on the left navigation, click Add to enter the creation interface, fill in the service name, description, priority (highest, high, medium, low), and the user and role notified by email (single or multiple roles). Associate service level agreements in the service configuration interface, supporting cloud resource deployment services, ticket services, task execution services, and many other service types. The parameters may be set as allowing changes when applying. When requesting services, the end user can choose the service level agreement again according to actual needs. After the end user initiates a service request, he/she can view SLA status information in My Request list. Four SLA status are defined: Normal, the remaining time accounts for the response time in the range of 50% -100% and the color is displayed in green. Waring, the remaining time accounts for 25% -50% of the response time and the color is displayed in yellow. Critical, the remaining time accounts for the response time 0-25 % and the color is displayed in orange. Overdue, the remaining time is below 0 and the color is displayed in red. When the SLA status changes, the configured user or role will be notified by email. Edit and Delete Service Level Agreement Select \"Service Design\"-\"Service Level Agreement\" in the left navigation, and click Edit on the service level agreement list interface to modify the relevant information of the agreement. Select \"Service Design\"-\"Service Level Agreement\" in the left navigation, and click Delete to delete the agreement. Copyright © 2016-2020 CloudChef. All Rights Reserved.

The request, operation, change, monitoring and recycling of cloud resources are all service-oriented, and enterprise-level processes, permissions and quota control are provided. Provides the ability to request any cloud service on one page, so that users can easily access various types of Alibaba Cloud services, VMware cloud resource services, container cloud services, ticket services, mail service and so on in the form of a service catalog. For example: Tomcat, MySQL cluster, J2EE three-tier application, etc. The example is as follows: Among them, ticket services are non-standardized services that require manual intervention and support, including service requests, event handling when cloud resources have problems, such as users who forget their passwords and need to reset them, or submit a request to open an email or account . The service catalog are all configured through the blueprint of the cloud management platform and then the corresponding parameter configuration. Services can be deployed in private clouds or public clouds. They can also be applied to more and more hybrid cloud deployments. For example, front-end applications are deployed on Alibaba Cloud and databases are deployed on private clouds. In the service catalog, you can also define service groups and place these services into categories to facilitate service management and search. Moreover, the service catalog can be diverse, and the services that different users can access can be set to create a user-oriented, personalized, and unified service portal with multiple cloud service types. When requesting a service, whether Alibaba Cloud services or VMware resources, the cloud platform provides a unified public cloud service experience, lowering the threshold for users to use, and displaying different configurations of each service according to resource usage and price The overall service cost. As shown below: Service Catalog Display After the service configuration is published successfully, you will see the published service card in the service catalog interface. The interface display of the service catalog supports two methods: Tab page display: Group display according to the tab page, you can quickly locate the service you need to apply for through the service group label, business group or search box. Hierarchical display: According to the card mode, first display the grouping (icon, name, description) in folder display mode, click on a grouping, and then display all the cards in this grouping. For cards without grouping, if you display according to the hierarchy, an ungrouped service folder will be added, click to enter all ungrouped cards. If the cards are grouped, this folder is not displayed. 「Note」 Service directory display method, select in the system configuration-interface configuration function area, the specific operation steps, please refer to:Interface configuration Tab page display When the service catalog is displayed as a tab page, you can use service grouping tags, such as: database, infrastructure, ticket services, etc., or through different business groups, or use the search box to quickly locate the service you need to apply for. Take \"Deploy a virtual machine on vSphere cloud platform\" as an example: Click \"Service Catalog\" on the left navigation bar, select a \"vSphere VM\" service, and click to enter the service application page Related parameters on the service request page: Organization Information Business group If the service is all business groups, that is, shared services, you need to select a business group (the business group must have related resource bundles, otherwise applications will not be allowed); if the service has already been assigned a business group during service configuration, you do not need to fill this. Project If the project is divided under this business group, you can select the project Owner Select the owner of the service. The owner must be a member of the business group, the owner of the service deployment. Support updating owner in service deployment. Deployment information Name If the service group has been configured with the “Service Deployment Name Naming Rule”, the service deployment name does not need to be filled in and will be automatically generated according to the business group rules. If the business group is not configured with the “Service Deployment Name Naming Rule”, it must be manually filled Quantity Enter the number of deployments. The default is 1. Execution time You can specify the time to start service deployment, accurate to the minute Key-value labels Checked by default, all server nodes use the same key-value labels. If not checked, all server nodes under the service deployment will be listed, and key-value labels can be set separately for each server node Other information Parameters of the form configuration If you customize the relevant fields for the cloud resource blueprint service and the manual order service in the form configuration of the service configuration, fill in the required information here Request parameters Request parameters If when configuring the service only the “Allow change” option is checked, the application parameter column will appear, and related server, network, and other components can be configured as required. Software configuration If you select “Add software when applying” during service configuration, a software configuration bar will appear. You can add software for the computing node / software component of the service. Click “Add Software” to select the software to be installed. All software components will be listed.

You can check the deployment status in \"Deployments\"-\"My Deployments\" (also see the deployment status in the \"Operation History\" in the upper right corner), Or check the approval process in \"Service Request\"-\"Pending Approval\". If when you apply for the service, you can’t fill in the relevant parameters all at once, click “Save” to save the filled parameters. In the next application, click “Load” to reload and automatically fill in the last filled in parameters. When you apply for a service, configure the charging rules in advance (private and public clouds are different, see below), the platform can display the cost of this application, and the specific configuration steps of the charging rules: For the private cloud, after the administrator configures the private cloud's charging rules in \"Billing & Usage\"-\"Billing Rules\", when users apply for services, they directly use the billing API to billing charging. For the public cloud, you need to cache the unit price API structure of the public cloud, and then calculate the cost. Hierarchy display Hierarchy display method, according to the card model, first display the service grouping. For specific, please refer to: Service Grouping In the service catalog view interface, you can view the icon, name, description, and folder display mode of the service group. Click a group to display all the cards of the service group. (Note: When the service card created by the administrator does not have a service group, if it is displayed in a hierarchy, this type of card will be stored in the \"Ungrouped Services\" folder. Click to enter all ungrouped cards. If the administrator created service cards are grouped, so the \"Ungrouped Services\" folder is not displayed.) Select Blueprint for Cloud Resource Request SmartCMP supports one service card to bind multiple blueprints and supports users to quickly select blueprints according to their needs. For example, the service card of \"Request Database\" is configured with Mysql, Oracl, NoSQL and other database-related blueprints in advance. For example: You can choose a blueprint self-service application by following these steps: Enter the \"Service Catalog\", click \"Apply\" on the \"Apply for Cloud Resources\" card, specify a blueprint to associate, and click \"Next\" \"Basic Information\" page, fill in: Business group The business group to which the deployment belongs Service deployment name Deployment name (if the service group has set a service deployment naming rule, the service deployment name will be automatically generated in accordance with the rules, there is no need to fill in) Project Deployment project Owner Deployment owner Fill in the relevant application parameters, such as: resource bundle, private network, virtual machine configuration, storage size, number of nodes, and so on.

For detailed usage parameters, please refer to the following table: Business group Business group Name Name (If the business group has set a naming rule, the name will be automatically generated according to the rules, no need to fill in) Project Project Owner Owner of the deployment Status Enabled, Stopped, Lost CPU usage Average CPU usage for a period of time (last week, last month, last three months, first half year) Memory usage Average usage of memory over the past period (last week, last month, last three months, first half year) Disk usage Average usage of disks in the past period (last week, last month, last three months, first half year) Usage Score The average usage of disk and memory usage and CPU usage over the past period of time, the average of the three (last week, last month, last three months, first half year). The smaller the score, the lower the usage rate and the more idle resources Cost Cost of deploying virtual machines for the next month is estimated based on the cost of deploying resources last month (values harmonize the cost of public and private clouds) The platform considers the usage rate of computing, network and storage. Based on data monitoring, it calculates the average of disk usage, memory usage and CPU usage in the past week, month, three months or half year. Give the sum of the usage scores. According to all the data shown above, find out the idle resources, sort and analyze the virtual machine with higher cost, and use the virtual machine with lower usage rate to perform one-click reconfiguration, optimize resource allocation, and improve resource utilization. How to reconfigure resources: Click on the left navigation \"Billing & Usage\" - \"Cost Optimization\", select an instance, enter the instance details page, display instance basic information, operation history, snapshot information, monitoring, triggered alerts, timing tasks, etc. The details page can reconfigure resources by doing the following:： Restart, suspend, stop, remote terminal, adjust virtual machine configuration, add new disk, expand disk, add network card, delete network card, create snapshot, restore to snapshot,vMotion migration, etc. Usage Restart Restart the (off state) virtual machine You can also trigger the task by setting the \"timing\" (at some point in the future). Suspend A suspended (powered on) virtual machine can be triggered by setting \"timing\" (at some point in the future) Stop Stop (i.e. shut down) the virtual machine (on the power-on state).

The platform supports multiple billing modes, including standard mode, professional mode, and public cloud billing. Standard mode means that the current billing specifications are billed for a single resource. You can select the cloud platform and resource bundle, specify the component type, and select specific components to set the price. For example: Set prices for all resource bundles under the Tencent cloud platform and IaaS component category instances. Professional mode, define a set of billing rules through scripts, for example: Alibaba Cloud has a variety of specifications, and the prices of different specifications are inconsistent. Use a script that supports JavaScript to define a set of Alibaba Cloud different specifications' billing price. Public cloud billing model, for public cloud resale business scenarios, tenant administrators can set different discount factors, currency conversion, and bill synchronization for different resources. Billing rules support multiple currency units, including RMB, USD, Saudi Riyal, etc. Tenant administrators can select a currency unit in the system configuration, (default RMB) can choose Saudi Riyal or US dollar. After that, the billing rules and the currency unit when the fund account is recharged are kept consistent with the configuration. The following describes the steps for adding, editing, and deleting billing rules: Click \"Billing & Usage\"-\"Billing Rules\" in the left menu bar, you will see a list of the created billing rules which lists the information of the resource types and prices that have been created. System administrators and tenant administrators can edit and delete the created billing specifications and add new billing specifications. Billing rules will display the cloud platform, resource category, storage category, pricing unit, price, currency unit, period, etc. Add billing rules: Go to the menu \"Billing & Usage\" - \"Billing Rules\", click \"Add\", select cloud platform management, resource bundle resource category (CPU, memory, storage component, floating IP, Load balancer, load balancer), pricing unit, price, currency unit (RMB), period (hour, day, week, month), click \"Submit\". Add the calculation of resource price successfully and the billing management list shows just added Information. Edit billing rules: Select an item in the list, click \"Edit\", modify the information and click \"Submit\" Delete the billing rule: Select an item in the list, click “Delete”, a confirmation prompt pops up, click “Yes” Billing synchronization Supports timing synchronization of public cloud billing data.

System Select \"Settings\"-\"System\" in the left menu bar: User Login Type A variety of login methods can be configured, including: local login: directly use the user name and password configured by SmartCMP to log in. LDAP/Microsoft Active Directory Regardless of the size and nature of the enterprise, a centralized account management system is required. Employees only need to set an account and password once to easily use different systems. (For example: administrative level OA system, mail system, conference room reservation system, etc.. The R&D team may have code management, project progress management, bug tracking, dependency management, Wiki, etc.) When choosing the classic LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) as the account management server, LDAP is an open, neutral, and industry standard application protocol that provides access control and maintains distributed information through the IP protocol. Connect OA system, code server, Jenkins and other systems to LDAP to realize sharing a set of accounts among all systems. \"LDAP Configuration\": LDAP Connection Name, LDAP URL (LDAP server address), Base DN, ROOT DN, Password After the configuration is complete, in the LDAP login UI, enter the LDAP uid/password to log in. After the authentication is successful, you can enter SmartCMP, but the user does not have any permissions after the first login. After the administrator configures ROLE and BG for this user, the user needs to log in again, and then perform other operations normally. OAuth2 OAuth2 is an open authorization standard that allows users to let third-party applications to access specific private resources of the user in a service, but does not provide account and password information to third-party applications. For example: user Xiaoming wants to log in to SmartCMP through his github account. The following introduces you the specific steps of how to log in using OAuth2 for SmartCMP.

At the same time, SmartCMP also pays attention to how to use resources more safely. The security here includes two aspects, one is safe access and use of resources, the other is data backup And recovery. The user accesses the virtual machine through the bastion host, helping to build a seamless connection between users, permissions, and resource management, which not only ensures that the cloud operation permissions can be controlled and audited, and the compliance can be followed, but also provide users with excellent use experience. System not only integrates the built-in bastion host, but also supports docking with third-party bastion hosts. Different bastion hosts can be configured for different resource bundles. When deploying resources, resources will be automatically registered to the bastion host configured by the resource. When the machine and resources are uninstalled, it will be automatically unbound from the bastion host, and the user does not need to install extra software or open multiple control interfaces separately. When users access the remote instance, they need to pass through the bastion host. We support multiple remote protocols based on cloud platform/RDP/VNC, provide a unified operation entrance, and build a safe and efficient operation channel. Provide a sound and compliant operation audit, including functions such as comprehensive operation records, operation videos, online video playback, retrospective operation failures, and manual interruption of abnormal operations. Every time the operation personnel log in to the virtual machine through Web SSH for operations, they will automatically use the Web SSH service of the bastion host. Each connection will generate a session record operation. The auditor can view the operations through real-time monitoring. If there is any violation of the rules, you can manually terminate one or more sessions. You can also view the detailed information of the session through the session history, and view the video record of the operation through video recording. In addition, SmartCMP has been docked with the Veeam backup platform. After docking with the backup platform, the virtual machine will have two more buttons \"backup and restore\". Users can self-service backup of individual files, folders, entire virtual machines and applications as needed. Flexible choice of backup point, you can quickly restore the backup data to the current instance. The user will view the execution process and results in the operation history for the backup and restoration operations performed on the resources. At this point, through the CMP single console, the use of bastion hosts, cloud resource backup, recovery management and self-service are realized to meet the internal backup needs of the organization, ensure service security and business continuity, reduce the burden on IT personnel, and reduce operation risk. The specific usage method is described below. Bastion Host SmartCMP supports accessing virtual machines through bastion hosts and scheduling various bastion hosts through a unified HTTP request. Core usage scenarios: Permission management: Integrate the access control of the bastion host and the platform (the platform and the bastion host are connected to the permission system, set user permissions, and set whether users can connect to the virtual machine through SSH or RDP. User management: all users accessing the virtual machine need to go through the bastion host. Operations: after the virtual machine is created, register the virtual machine to the bastion host; after the virtual machine is deleted, log out the virtual machine from the bastion host; after the virtual machine changes, update the bastion host. For example when a virtual machine’s owner is changed, the registration information of the virtual machine in the bastion host is modified synchronously. Session management and video playback: The platform also supports the bastion host session management function. When the user performs operations on the remote instance through the bastion host, a real-time session link will be formed, and the tenant administrator can view the current ongoing session. If an exception is found, the administrator can manually terminate one or more sessions by clicking terminate to disconnect the corresponding user's session. User can also view the history of all the sessions, learn the details of each historical session, and click playback to view the recording. Dock Bastion Host The platform supports the docking of Guacamole bastion host and Anheng bastion host, with Webssh and remote terminal, which is convenient for users to remotely operate. Take the Guacamole bastion host as an example, the specific configuration steps are as follows: Specific configuration steps: Specific steps for accessing Guacamole (ie Apache Guacamole) bastion host: Click \"Backup & Security\"-\"Guacamole\" on the left navigation bar, click Add, fill in the bastion host information, name (virtual machine name), description, Guacd Address (that is, the URL link of the bastion host) and Guacd port (that is, the access port of the bastion host). SmartCMP uses Cloudchef-Integration to verify if the login information is correct. Connect to third-party bastion hosts, for example: Qizhi bastion hosts, access through the \"bastion host entrance\". \"Guacamole bastion host\" is the embedded bastion host management interface of SmartCMP. Bind the bastion host to the resource bundle: Click the \"Infrastructure\"-\"Resource Bundle Management\" on the left navigation bar, and specify one of the bastion hosts that have been connected. For example: when adding a vSphere resource bundle, bind the bastion host Guacd, the virtual machine deployed using the vSphere resource bundle will be automatically registered to the bastion host, and the virtual machine deployed using the vSphere resource bundle will be automatically unregistered from the bastion host when it is uninstalled. Use of the bastion host. After the vSphere resource bundle is bound to the bastion host, use the vSphere resource bundle to successfully deploy the instance. Click the left navigation bar \"Deployments\"-\"Instance\"-\"Overview\" tab, select Remote protocol types, including: based on cloud platform, RDP or VNC (choose based on RDP or VNC, you need to select the remote protocol port). After the selection is completed, click \"Remote Terminal\" and you can directly pass \"RDP or VNC\". The instance is configured to open the remote terminal on the cloud platform. You can modify the parameters of the protocol information through the remote terminal, for example, modify the user name and password of the virtual machine. Every time the operation personnel logs in to the virtual machine through Web SSH for operation, system will automatically use the bastion host's Web SSH service, and each connection will generate a session record of operation. Audit personnel may click on the \"Backup & Security\"-\"Guacamole\"-active session on the left navigation bar to check if there's any illegal operation, if found, they can manually click the \"terminate\" button to immediately terminate the session. Click \"Backup & Security\"-\"Guacamole\"-Session Management on the left navigation bar to view the detailed information of the session, including: host name, IP address, protocol, Guacd name, user name, start time, duration and operation recording. Click Play to play the operation video online. Backup system SmartCMP supports fast and reliable backup of all instances on the vSphere cloud platform based on Veeam. Configure the backup management platform and bind the resource bundle to the backup management platform. The instances deployed in this resource bundle can be managed by Veeam. Supports recovery of individual files, entire virtual machines, applications, and more, ensuring service security and high availability. Core usage scenarios: Backup: It is an instant backup (that is, manual backup). Click this operation to trigger a backup operation. The backup parameters may include the name of the backup file. The parameters need to be configured. You can view the execution process and results of backup operations (successful or failed backups) in the operation history. For example: backup the current entire instance, similar to taking a snapshot Restore: Supports selecting a backup point and restoring in the current instance (The backup point is a list, allowing the user to select the name of the backup file, time information, more additional parameters need to be configured in the form. Click on the backup point and trigger the restoration process restoring the data of the backup point to the current instance.) The execution process and result of the restoration operation (successful restoration or failure) can be viewed in the operation history. For example: a backup copy of the instance is restored to the current cloud virtual machine Specific configuration steps: Backup management portal configuration: Click \"Backup & Security\"-\"Backup Management Platform\" on the left navigation bar, click Add, fill in Veeam information, name (name of Veeam system platform), description, Veeam address (i.e. URL link of Veeam platform) , Username and password (i.e. login username and password for Veeam platform) Bind to the resource bundle: Click the \"Infrastructure\"-\"Resource bundle Management\" cloud platform resource information tab on the left navigation bar to specify the backup management platform that has been connected. For example, when adding a vSphere resource bundle, bind the backup management platform Veeam, and the virtual machines deployed using the vSphere resource bundle will be automatically associated with Veeam, and the instance will be managed through the backup management platform. Backup and restore operations. After the vSphere resource bundle is bound to the backup management platform Veeam, the instance successfully deployed using the vSphere resource bundle. Click Deployments\"-\"Instances\" on the left navigation bar. Support basic \"Backup\" / \"Restore\" operation. Audits Support records of user access and operation information. The tenant administrator and sysadmin have this permission by default. If you need to add this permission to other roles, please add a role and add this permission. For details, see Roles Click \"System Management\"-\"Operation Audit\" on the left navigation bar, you can see the operation records of the tenant. It displays the operator, operation object, operation name, operation parameter, status, and operation time. You can use \"Advanced Search\" for quick filtering and positioning. It supports the filtering of operators, statuses, operating objects,and start and end times. You can also use ordinary search functions. Copyright © 2016-2020 CloudChef. All Rights Reserved.

Cloud resource blueprint service scenario The Cloud Resource Blueprint Service is based on blueprint modeling to define standard service frameworks and components, providing a rich set of out-of-the-box software components to visualize blueprints for automated deployment. For example, configuring a vSphere single-node virtual machine service is a typical scenario for a cloud resource blueprint service. Ticket service scenario The user applies for a service through the service catalog, and the service group receives and performs the ticket processing operation. There are two types of ticket services: Apply for non-standardized resources (for example, apply for a cloud resource blueprint service to uninstall a service deployment.) Services that require IT manual intervention (for example, manual ticket service for resetting passwords.) 「Note」For more guidance on cloud resource blueprint service and manual ticket service, please refer to:Cloud Resource Guidelines和Request Service This chapter helps users get started with service request and self-service. Service request: In the Service Catalog, you can use the quick request function, select the required blueprint, apply quickly, and automate the deployment. Self-service operation: View detailed information about service deployment, instances or cloud resources in the Deployments menu, and perform self-service operation. The next section will explain how to request service. Log in Enter SmartCMP IP in browser, such as: http://SmartCMP-Public-IP/#/login and enter username & password Request Service After the service is successfully published, you can view and apply for the published service in service catalog. Click Service Catalog, select the vSphere single-node service or OpenStack single-node service configured in the previous section, and click to enter the service request interface. View the details of the service on this page, such as: organization information, deployment information, application parameters, etc. Fill in/modify relevant information, if not enter the next step directly Click Apply and the request is successful after approved by the process control (approval template) of the business group. Since Default business group has no approval process, service will be deployed directly after request. Self-service Operation After the service is requested, you can check the status of the deployment in Deployment - My Deployment. If there is an approval process, you can go to “Requests” - “Pending Approval” to view the current approval process. Click on the service deployment request number to enter the approval details page of the blueprint deployment to view the current approval process. If there is no approval process, click on the service deployment name to go to the deployment details page to view basic information, topology and operation history.

Software components associate with product warehouse and custom application deployment methods and related parameters. Define application services: Model the application architecture through blueprint modeling; specify resource parameters and versions of related applications through service configuration. Define the pipeline: configure the pipeline stage and various types of tasks to achieve full lifecycle management of application testing, deployment, update, operation and recycling. SmartCMP supports permission management for continuous integration and release functions. When the administrator configures the pipeline, the administrator binds a project to the pipeline and adds global parameters to be called in the later tasks. The project team members under the project have the authority to add, edit, delete, execute, disable, lock the automation pipeline, and view the execution history of the pipeline. Pipeline SmartCMP's pipeline helps users build automated, reusable, and securely compliant applications for continuous delivery and deployment. The pipeline consists of a series of stages, each consisting of multiple tasks and environments that the software must complete before it is released to production. Currently, it supports the customization and assembly of multiple phases and tasks and can add any number of execution tasks in the stage. Through them, it is possible to design development, deployment, and operation pipelines applicable to various scenarios. Add a pipeline, bind a project, and add global parameters to make calls in later tasks. Specific steps: Click \"CI/CD\" - \"Pipeline\" in the left navigation bar, click Create, enter the name, description, project, notification to the user on the basic information page. Set the custom properties, click the Add button, enter the name, value, description, click Create After you have created the pipeline, click \"CI/CD\" - \"Pipeline\" in the left navigation bar to edit, delete, execute, disable or lock the pipeline. Configuring Triggers Customize the trigger condition of the pipeline. The trigger defines when the pipeline is automatically run. You can manually trigger the pipeline task, or you can set the policy to trigger the pipeline task automatically by the trigger. SmartCMP trigger types include: Webhook integration (support Git, Gitlab and other code repository change triggers), Jenkins triggers, timing triggers, manual triggers, and more. For example: add a configuration Gitlab event trigger, when the code is submitted to the Gitlab code repository, the repository status changes, triggering the pipeline. Specific steps: Click \"CI/CD\" - \"Pipeline\" in the left navigation bar, click Create, click Create on the trigger page. Enter the trigger name (Gitlab code commit), type (WEBHOOK), description (optional). Click Create to complete trigger configuration. Configure Phases and Tasks Different phases can be defined according to the needs of the business, and the tasks that need to be completed are defined in each phase. For example, you can define different stages of software packaging, deploying test environments, and more. The task types for each phase include Jenkins Job tasks, service provision tasks, cloud resource tasks, script tasks, and more. The publisher of the pipeline can define the parameters for each task and make calls in subsequent tasks. A task is a specific activity performed. Supports custom task types, input and output parameters, where input and output parameters refer to the parameter transfer between each task of the SmartCMP support pipeline, for example, the IP address of the newly deployed virtual machine of the previous task is transmitted to the next task for calling. For example, deploying tasks through a blueprint can automatically trigger a published cloud resource service to deploy cloud resources. Cloud resource tasks can automate cloud resource changes and operations and upgrade and update application software. Specific steps in the design of the flow phase and tasks: Click \"CI/CD\" - \"Pipeline\" in the left navigation bar, click Create, click the Add button on the process page, enter the stage name, click Add Click Add Serial Task to fill in the task details page: task type, name, description, notification to the user, fill in the input parameters, customize the output parameters (the input and output parameters change accordingly to different task type) Select the wait task and fill in the wait time (s) at the input parameters Select the service provision task and fill in the services (services published in the service catalog) and templates at the input parameters Jenkins task, fill in the warehouse endpoint at the input parameters, task type, choose whether to wait for the result, if it is unstable, mark it as success to continue or mark as failure, end execution Select the cloud resource task, select the existing cloud resource at the input parameter, cloud resource type, operation (day2 operation and maintenance of the cloud resource includes mounting, adjusting the disk configuration, etc.) Execute the timeout period in the setup, execution options (Failure and continue, Failure and over), execution mode (select default execute or condition execute) View Pipeline Execution History Through the execution history, you can view the execution status, executor, execution time, and detailed information of each stage task execution. Click \"CI/CD\" - \"Execution History\" in the left navigation bar to quickly locate the pipeline according to the filter conditions (item, status, start and end time). Click on the pipeline to view the flow chart of the execution status (in progress, success, failure), executor information, start time, end time, time consumption, and complete pipeline.

Specific ticket service function description: Ticket Request: Supports users to apply for ticket services in the service catalog. Ticket Tracking: After the service catalog request form is completed, it supports the user to enter My Requests to view the service details. Below you will be introduced to the detailed steps of the ticket request and tracking process. Request Ticket Users can apply for a configured service or shared service in the service catalog. Click “Service Catalog” in the left navigation bar, select manual ticket service, click to enter the service request page. In the service request page, fill in the details of the service: title, ticket description, priority, urgency, applicant, email, mobile phone number. When the administrator has configured additional field information for the form, the user can fill in the required fields on the details page. For example, to apply for a new project, the administrator configures the fields (projects, descriptions, project members) for the form, and the user fills in the relevant information when applying for a new project. Click Apply and the ticket service is applied successfully. Track tickets After the user initiates the ticket request in the service catalog, according to the pre-configured process of the administrator, the system distributes the ticket to the corresponding service group according to the relationship between the service group and the ticket. After the specified user or role in the service team receives the ticket request, they can take the ticket voluntarily or transfer to others, or process offline, and the ticket status is updated after completion. When the administrator associates the service level agreement for the ticket service, which defines the expected time for the service to complete, both the service initiator and the acceptor can track the service in time to improve service efficiency. The user can view the details of the SLA and the remaining time (the difference from the expected service resolution time at this moment). The system will notify the user via email. The user can close the service request, the ticket status is changed to processed, and the service request is completed. If the user request to re-process the ticket, the ticket will be returned to the service group for re-processing, and the ticket status is changed to being processed. There are two types of service requests: cloud resource blueprint service requests and manual ticket service requests.Tracking the manual ticket service process and seeing the details of the manual ticket service are similar to the method of viewing the cloud resource blueprint service request details above. Pending Processed After the service catalog request ticket service is completed, the user can view detailed information such as ticket processing status, processing personnel, processing information, processing method, and processing result in the Requests. Here displays the pending processed part of the request. Click \"Requests\" - \"Pending Processed\" on the left menu bar to view a list of all pending requests for that user. This page displays the request number, request type, service name, title, applicant, business group, project, request status (in process), request time, and completion time. Click on Request No. to view the details of the application. 「Note」When the user has a relationship with the service group, the manual ticket is assigned to the user, and the user has the right to process the ticket. The user may go to the pending processed page to view the ticket information to be processed. Processed Here display the requests that the service group has processed and the applicant has confirmed to close. Click \"Requests\" - \"Processed\" in the left navigation bar, and the page displays the processed part of all processing requests initiated. Display the basic information of the processing request: request number, request type, service name, title, applicant, business group, project, request status, request time, completion time. Select a request, click the “Request Number” link, and go to the My Request Details page to view the detailed information of the request. 「Note」When the user has an association with the service group, the manual ticket is assigned to the user, and the user has the right to process the ticket. The ticket status is updated to “completed” after the ticket processing is completed. Copyright © 2016-2020 CloudChef. All Rights Reserved.
