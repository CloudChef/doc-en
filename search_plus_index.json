Tenants are the architectural units in SmartCMP. In a SmartCMP deployment, multiple tenants can be configured. Tenants provide isolation boundaries for resource usage and management configurations. The dedicated configuration in each tenant is listed below: Logo and theme color: Different logo and theme color schemes can be customized for each tenant and configured in the management control interface. User: Each tenant has independent user management. You can create a local user while users of tenant A can only access tenant A and cannot access other tenants. You can also configure each tenant with a directory service for authentication, like Microsoft Active Directory or another LDAP server. Multiple tenants can use the same directory service, but the same user can belong to only one tenant, and users with the same ID cannot be configured in different tenants. Entitlement: Each tenant has an independent entitlement configuration. The permissions configured in tenant A are limited to the scope of tenant A and do not work for other tenants. Workflow: Each tenant administrator can configure workflows, such as approval processes, service processes, etc., to be applied within the scope of this tenant. Cloud platform management and resource bundle configuration: Each tenant admin or infrastructure admin can connect and manage the cloud platform portals required for the tenant, such as VMware vCenter, AWS/Azure/Alibaba cloud, etc. You can configure and manage different cloud platform portals in different tenants, or you can share the same cloud platform portals by configuring different resource bundles to access different computing resources (for example, different clusters in vCenter) for users in different tenants. Service Catalog: Each tenant's architect can design a service blueprint for the tenant. The administrator publishes the service catalog that the user can self-request according to different departments and environments. Categories and service items in the service catalog remain independent among different tenants. Tenant Single tenant and multiple tenants Single tenant In single tenant deployment, all configurations appear in the default tenant. Administrators can manage cloud resources and organizational structures and configure specific service catalogs within tenants. Multiple tenants In multi-tenant environment, each tenant has a separate configuration that is managed by the administrator. System administrators can configure, view and manage configurations in multiple tenants. Business group and projects Within each tenant, different organizational structures may be created including business groups and projects. Business group A business group is a logical organizational structure within a tenant. User can creates a corresponding business group for a company's department, organization, or business unit. Tenant administrators can create multi-level business groups, and users associated with business groups can use resources and services in the business group. Independent rules, processes, and resources can be configured for each business group: Associate one or more resource bundles with each business group Associate users with each business group. A user can belong to multiple business groups Configure different approval processes, operation permissions, cloud resource usage leases, cloud resource naming specifications, etc. Project In SmartCMP, cloud resources within a project are visible to all members of the project and are invisible to all members of other projects. A project is subordinate to a business group and can contain multiple users. A user can join multiple projects. Role A role consists of a set of permissions that can be associated with a user to determine the functions that the user can manage, configure, and use in SmartCMP. Based on individual responsibilities, each user can be associated with one or more roles, and the permissions will be a superposition of those roles. After deployment of SmartCMP, following roles will be provided by default: Tenant roles overview A tenant-wide role has the corresponding responsibilities of that particular tenant and does not affect other tenants in the system. You can create custom roles as needed to be associated with users. Tenant Admin Usually responsible for the overall tenant structure. Tenant administrators configure SmartCMP based on their tenants' internal organizational needs, responsible for tenant internal process and policy configuration, organizational structure configuration, user and permission configuration, and more. Main duty: Create and manage users and tenant roles, assign roles and permissions to users and create service teams Create and manage business groups and assign business group administrators to each business group Create and manage service processes and approval processes Perform tenant system configuration, including catalog service information, mail system information, access to dashboards and reports, etc. Software Architect Usually responsible for designing services that companies and organizations need to apply for and use. Services come in a variety of styles, from a single virtual machine to complex applications including network load balancing, web applications, and databases. Main duty: Create and manage software components Create and modify blueprints, model them according to business needs, and define the components included in the blueprint, including infrastructure components and software components Publish a blueprint Unpublish and delete blueprints that need to be removed Infrastructure administrator The infrastructure administrator connects one or more cloud platforms to each tenant, manages virtual machine templates (that is, operating system images) in the cloud platform, and calculates specifications (that is, instance types). Create a resource pool, specify the infrastructure resources of each cloud platform, and assign them to the business group for use. At the same time, according to the blueprint designed by the software architect, infra admin can make configurations for different business groups or environment requirements and publish to service catalog. Main duty: Connect cloud platform Create and distribute resource bundles and manage cloud platform and inventory cloud resources Configure and manage VM templates (that is, operating system images) of the cloud platform and computing specifications (that is, instance types). Manage IP address pool Configure and publish services based on blueprints released by software architects Manage service catalog Analyze resource utilization and recycle expired resources Business group roles overview A role on a business group scope has the corresponding responsibilities of that particular business group and does not affect other business groups. BG admin Manage one or more business groups, usually department managers. Main duty: Add users to business group and associate roles Configure policies such as lease duration and naming specification for cloud resources Configure business group cloud resource operation entitlement and service deployment operation entitlement, specify the operations that the user can perform (such as powering on and off, adding disks, adjusting configuration, etc.) and the required approval process Create a project and assign a project administrator Monitor resource utilization in the business group. If resources are scarce, you can apply for resource expansion BG member All users in a business group can request services published to the business group (including services shared to all business groups). Users can request services from the service catalog and manage the resources they own. Main duty: Self-service request Check configuration and monitoring information of owned cloud resources to perform self-service operation (the operation entitlement is configured by business group). Self-service alert setting for the cloud resources it owns. Project roles overview A role on a project scope has the corresponding responsibility for that particular project and does not affect other projects. Project Admin Manage one or more projects, usually project managers. Main duty: Add users to the project and associate roles View cloud resources owned by the project Project member Project member is also a member of the business group to which the project belongs, so it can request publishing services to the business group and can view resources and perform operations. At the same time,all members of the same project can view the resources in this project. Service Group Service group is a collection of service personnel who process request services during the request service management process. Tenant administrators can create one or more service groups and assign members to each service group. Main duty: After the user applies for the manual work order service that needs manual intervention through the service catalog, according to the pre-configured service process, the corresponding service group will receive the work order for processing. After receiving the work order, the personnel in the service group can transfer, or perform offline processing, update the work order status after completing the task, and return the work order to the request user for confirmation and closure.

After connecting the cloud platform, you can distribute resources such as calculation, storage, and network through resource bundles to be assigned to different service groups. At the same time, you can create virtual machine templates and computing specifications (that is, instance types) in SmartCMP, and encapsulate and abstract virtual machine templates (or operating system images) and computing specifications (that is, instance types) of each cloud platform for unified management and automated calls. Cloud platform You can enter access information for each cloud platform in SmartCMP to connect and manage. For example, virtualization management controller address, username and password, or public cloud access key. The following table lists the information that needs to be entered for each cloud platform portal: Cloud Platform Type Connect Method vSphere vCenter Server OpenStack OpenStack Management Controller PowerVC PowerVC Management Controller Hyper-V Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager(SCVMM) Server Physical Machine SmartCMP physical server management node information Aliyun Aliyun Service Account AccessKey AWS AWS Service Account AccessKey Microsoft Azure Azure API Access Credentials Tencent Cloud Tencent Cloud Service Account AccessKey QingCloud QingCloud Service Account AccessKey VMware NSX NSX Management Controller Cisco ACI ACI Management Controller F5 F5 Management Controller Resource Bundle In a resource bundle, you can specify a set of resource objects in the cloud platform as resource portals for deploying virtual machines or other cloud resources. The resource object can be a cluster of computers in a virtualization platform or an area of a public cloud. Resources, such as computing, storage, and network, are classified and specified through resource bundles,and are distributed to different business groups for consumption and use by members in the business group. For example, you can assign different datastores and virtual switches in a vSphere cluster to different resource bundles, allowing different departments to deploy resources using different storage and networks. Or specify public-cloud-specific zones, availability zones, and VPC to enable the public cloud services deployed through the resource bundle to uniformly use the resources of the available area and isolate network from other services through VPC. The following table lists the resource entrance configurations for each cloud platform resource bundle: Cloud Platform Type Resource Bundle Entrance vSphere vSphere Cluster OpenStack OpenStack Availability Zone PowerVC PowerVC Availability Zone Hyper-V Hyper-V Cluster Aliyun Aliyun Zone, Availability Zone, and VPC AWS AWS Zone, Availability Zone, and VPC Microsoft Azure Azure Subscription ID, zone, and resource group QingCloud QingCloud Zone, Availability Zone, and VPC One or more resource bundles (including multiple resource bundles from the same cloud platform) can be associated with each business group. At the same time, each resource bundle can be assigned to one business group or shared to multiple or all service groups. You can: Specify the computing resources of the virtualization platform, or the area of the public cloud, the availability zone, etc. Set the available resource quota, including the number of CPUs, the amount of memory, the number of virtual machines that can be deployed, etc. Specify specific storage resources and network resources Manually import the inventory resources in the cloud platform or set a timing policy to automatically synchronize the inventory resources in the cloud platform. For example, you can create a vSphere resource bundle: Specify a vSphere cluster in the managed vCenter to provide computing resources; Set the resource quota of the resource bundle: the number of CPUs, the amount of memory, the number of virtual machines that can be deployed, the number of snapshots allowed, and so on; Specify the data stores that can be used and set the storage space available for each data store; Specify the virtual switch that can be used and set the IP address allocation method. Virtual Machine Template You can define one or more operating systems (such as CentOS) in SmartCMP. Operating system is a logical concept. Each operating system can be associated with templates or images from different cloud platforms (for example, a CentOS virtual machine template in vCenter, or a CentOS image in Aliyun). Operating system and virtual machine templates will be used when the service is configured. Computing Specification Computing specification defines the configuration specifications of the computer CPU and memory. On SmartCMP, like the operating system, computing specification is a logical concept, and you can associate specifications or instance types in different cloud platforms for each computing specification (such as specifications in the OpenStack platform, or instance types in the AWS public cloud). Wait). Computing specifications and cloud platform specifications will be used during service configuration. Through the abstraction of the operating system and computing specifications, you can create different operating systems as needed to associate virtual machine templates that conform to enterprise security specifications. At the same time, create different computing specifications and specify specific instance types (such as reserved instance types that have been purchased). You can specify the operating system and virtual machine templates when the service is being configured and publish standardized services for users to apply. IP Address Management You can create and manage IP pools to automate the allocation of IP addresses when deploying cloud resources. IP pools can support multi-cloud heterogeneous environments, for example creating an IP pool and assigning it to vSphere and OpenStack platforms at the same time. With IP address management, you can view the utilization of IP addresses, history logs, and manually occupy and release IP addresses. Key Pair Key pairs are login credentials required by users to access virtual machines of different cloud platforms. Infrastructure administrators and tenant administrators can manage key pairs, including creating, importing, downloading, and deleting. Copyright © 2013-2019 CloudChef. All Rights Reserved.

These services can be infrastructure services (such as virtual machines, firewalls, DNS, etc.), application services (such as databases, or integrated applications including network load balancing, Web components, and databases), etc. Manual Request Service: Services that are not standardized and require manual intervention and support, including service requests, event handling, and so on. For example, if the user forgets the password which needs to be reset or submits a request to open an email or account or encounters an IT service problem which needs to be resolved (the server, printer or network cannot be accessed, etc.). The user can initiate a work order request service through the service catalog, and the service team will receive the request and process. The following diagram depicts the logical connections between components, blueprints, services, and deployments. Components include software components and infrastructure components. Software architect builds the topology map of the application and configures resources and parameters for the service, publishing the service card to the service catalog. Members of the business group apply for self-service in the service catalog according to actual needs, and the services are automatically combined according to policies and specifications to complete automated deployment and delivery. Component A component is the basic unit that makes up a blueprint. The components in SmartCMP consist of two types: Infrastructure components: including computing components (e.g., virtual machines, containers, etc.), network components (e.g., load balancing, security groups, firewalls, etc.), storage components (e.g., disks, object storage, etc.). These components are built into SmartCMP and can be selected during blueprint design. Software components: for the installation of application software, including middleware, relational databases, non-relational databases, and so on. You can standardize configuration properties and use scripts to specify how to install, configure, uninstall, or update components during software deployment (you can also customize the other operations you need). Software architects can create custom components, update existing components, or delete components that have been removed through the software component management interface. Software components can be used with infrastructure components when designing blueprints. Blueprint A blueprint is a complete specification of the overall application, including computing, storage, networking, software, etc., used to determine attributes and dependencies, workflows, and execution strategies for various resources. You can create a standardized service framework by designing blueprint on visualized canvas and combining one or more components. Once the blueprint is published, it can be used to create a service. Blueprints can take many forms, for example, a blueprint may contain: A network component and a virtual machine component A firewall component or a public cloud relational database component Multi-level application architecture, such as: network load balancing, web applications and databases A hybrid orchestration of multiple cloud platform components, such as a web application deployed in Aliyun while a database in a vSphere private cloud, or a web application in a Kubernetes container while a database in an OpenStack private cloud. Workflow Workflow defines the sequence and strategy of activities or tasks performed at each step in the automated process. Workflows in SmartCMP are divided into the following three types. Each type includes a built-in process that can be used directly. These built-in processes cannot be modified or deleted. You can also customize the workflows you need through a visual process designer. Cloud Resource Blueprint Service: Defines the process of automated deployment of cloud resources, including built-in workflows for standard cloud service deployment. Manual Request Service: Defines the task and flow mode of each step of the request service, including built-in workflows such as standard manual requests and standard event management. Approval process: It is used to control whether a user should obtain approval of someone in the organization when applying for service or performing operations on a cloud resource. Please remind that in those versions before 5.1 or those upgraded from the old version, the approval process configuration menu is provided for compatibility with the approval process in the old version. However, this feature will be turned off in the future, and it is recommended that you use workflow to create and manage the approval process. Form When a user requests a service in the service catalog, each service you create and publish displays a form. When creating or configuring each service, you can use the default form. If you need to modify or add additional field information for users to fill in at the time of request, you can customize the form through the form designer. Catalog Group Catalog groups are used to organize different services into related types, making it easier for users to browse the services they need. For example: infrastructure services, database services, manual request services, and more. You can create new groups as needed to categorize the services you need to publish. Service Publishing Tenant administrators or infrastructure administrators can deploy blueprints and workflows that have been released, according to different organizational or departmental requirements, and publish them as services in the service catalog. A service can be published to a business group so that only members of the business group can apply while it can also be posted to all business groups and shared with all members for request. In the process of service configuration: For cloud resource deployment services, you can specify a complete specification of the deployment, such as virtual machine configuration (required virtual machine template, computing size, disk configuration, etc.), lease, operation entitlement, approval process, service workflow, customization forms, etc. For request services, you can specify the service team, approval process, service workflow, custom form, and more for each step of the task. Lease Period Lease period includes the lease time, retention time and recycle bin recovery time: When the lease time expires, all computing resources in the service deployment will be shut down; When the retention time expires, the service deployment will be placed in the recycle bin; In the Recycle Bin, you can restore or manually delete them (the resources will be completely released from the cloud platform). If you do nothing, the resources will be automatically deleted after the reclaim time expires (these resources will be completely released from the cloud platform). Approval Process Approval process can be set up separately in business group and service configuration: Approval process configured by the business group will take effect for all services in the business group; If a service is configured with an approval process separately, the process will override those in the business group. If no process is configured, the approval process for the business group configuration will be used. Service Deployment When user request the cloud resource service, after approval (if the approval process is configured), SmartCMP will be deployed according to the policy and specification of the service configuration, and then delivered to the user for use. Service deployment refers to all cloud resources included in the service requested by the user, such as a virtual machine, a database, or a multi-tiered application environment. Users can use all the resources deployed by the service during the configured service lease period and can self-service operations or changes according to the operation entitlement configured by the administrator. Service Deployment and Naming Specification for Cloud Resources You can configure naming specifications for each business group to standardize the service deployment and the names of the cloud resources it contains, including the service deployment name, virtual machine display name, and the Windows or Linux operating system hostname. To ensure the uniqueness of the naming, you can add a naming suffix to it. The naming suffix can be a sequence of numbers or a random string of custom length. You can specify an initialization sequence number for the sequence of numbers. For example, you can create a naming suffix with a length of 3 and an initialization sequence number of 1. If the specified business group name plus the suffix is the naming specification for the virtual machine name, then names of virtual machines deployed in the Dev business group will be Dev001, Dev002, and so on. Service Deployment and Operation Entitlement for Cloud Resources Operation entitlement refers to a change or operation that is authorized to be performed by a user for service deployment or cloud resources. You can disable or enable certain actions and set up an approval process for enabled actions. There are two types of operation entitlements: Service deployment operations are for service deployment level operations, including extending lease, changing business group, project, owner, etc. to which the service deployment belongs; Cloud resource operations are for virtual machines or other cloud resources, including powering on/off, remote connections, disk additions, migrations, and more. The operation entitlement can be set separately in the business group and service configuration: The operation entitlement configured for each business group will be valid for all service deployments and cloud resources of the business group; Each service inherits the operation entitlement of the business group by default. You can also configure an operation entitlement for the service separately, overriding those in the business group. Copyright © 2013-2019 CloudChef. All Rights Reserved.

The software industry is increasingly aware that in order to deliver software products and services continuously, efficiently, and reliably, DevOps must work closely together to automate software lifecycle management through automated tool collaboration and communication. The core scenarios include: By setting up stages and tasks to automate the packaging of applications, environment deployment, automated testing, etc., configure an automated pipeline for continuous release and continuous deployment that is suitable for the characteristics of the development team. The SmartCMP Application Release Pipeline works seamlessly with continuous integration tools such as Jenkins, Git, and Nexus to automate application deployment and upgrades, and achieve continuous delivery and deployment from development to testing to production. Based on the blueprint, automate the deployment of each application topology blueprint and let the platform automate the triggering of pipelines and execution releases, test, manage product and automate deployment based on policy. Support the deployment of any application to any cloud to open up development, testing, and production environments. Automate online or update applications in production environments with proven architectures, programs, and deployment tools to ensure consistency of cross-cloud deployments and changes, reducing deployment and operational risk. Deployment automation integrates the entire tool chain from an application-centric perspective (automatically completes software development projects including continuous builds, application configuration, product archiving, resource deployment, monitoring operations, etc.), manages and visualizes candidate versions deployment for the entire pipeline, quickly getting the right product deployment to the appropriate environment, thus building a bridge between Dev and Ops. R&D and testers self-apply for cloud resources or services through the SmartCMP service catalog, reducing the time lost in collaboration between DevOps, enabling teams to work together, iterate functions and release products more efficiently. CI/CD Tool Chain SmartCMP integrates a rich CI/CD toolchain to provide code management, continuous build, product management, deployment, monitoring and operation, and more for applications, and provides an open API. All features are based on a comprehensive integration framework that includes mainstream software tools: GitLab, GitHub, Jenkins, Maven, Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Nexus, Kafka, etc., enabling developers to have more efficient code management and operators to change the application with less risk, improving the quality of the application and reducing the risk of deploying features. Pipeline SmartCMP automated pipelines create automated, reusable, secure, and compliant application delivery processes, custom configuration builds, deployments, and end-to-end process governance and control. The pipeline is automated, distributed across different environments and stages and achieves full lifecycle deployment and release management. Both the definition of the pipeline and the execution of the pipeline provide a friendly interactive interface. The configuration of the pipeline can be mastered through simple practice. The pipeline process can also be intuitively sensed during the pipeline operation. The pipeline consists of a series of stages, each consisting of multiple tasks and environments that the software must complete before it is released to production, describing the operations that need to be performed in order to achieve the desired results. Pipelining is built in successive stages that contain one or more parallel or serial tasks. The entire pipeline is defined as follows: Add a pipeline, bind a project, and add global parameters to call in later tasks Customize the trigger condition of the pipeline, like when the pipeline is automatically run. You can manually trigger the pipeline task or set the policy to trigger the pipeline task automatically by the trigger to achieve flexible pipeline trigger conditions. Trigger types include Jenkins triggering; Webhook integration (support Git, Gitlab and other code repository to change triggers); manual triggering;timing triggering. Define stages and tasks based on business needs. Stage A stage is a group of tasks that are parallel or serial. When the current stage of the task meets the rules and execution is completed, it is promoted to the next stage in the pipeline. SmartCMP pipeline supports the customization and assembly of multiple stages and tasks and can add any number of execution tasks in the stage through which it is possible to design development, deployment, and operation pipelines applicable to various scenarios. Based on the secondary development capabilities of SmartCMP, you can expand your needs for more personalized scenarios. The stages are divided into several types, including: Code compilation stage: build binary files. Unit testing stage: Run all unit tests and analyze code quality, such as: development, functional testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), load testing (LT), system integration testing (SIT). Packaging stage: Build the final package, virtual machine image or Docker image. The parameters of the input and output and the execution time can be defined during the execution of the stage task, and the stage can be enabled under the specified conditions. For example, you can define different stages of software packaging, deployment of test environments, and so on. The task types for each stage include Jenkins Job tasks, deploying new application tasks, cloud resource change tasks, script execution tasks, etc. After the pipeline is executed, user can view the execution status of each stage and task, as well as output information. Task Each stage of the task is an activity or job in the software development process, which can be to acquire artifacts, automate deployment, run unit tests, create tasks, run custom workflows or scripts, etc. The task definitions for the SmartCMP pipeline include: Custom task types: Jenkins Job tasks, new application deployment tasks, cloud resource change tasks, application update tasks, script execution tasks, and other custom tasks; The publisher of the pipeline can define the input and output parameters for each task and make calls in subsequent tasks. For example, through a blueprint deployment task, it supports deploying any new application to various rich environments such as Windows, Linux, and K8s containers, that is, it can automatically trigger a published cloud resource service to deploy cloud resources. Tasks can automate cloud resource changes and operations, and upgrade and update application software. Relying on the standard operation module and the underlying capabilities of the SmartCMP platform, you can design a variety of complex operation scenarios to meet the needs of large-scale deployment and massive operations Execution History Through the execution history, you can view the execution status, executor, execution time, and detailed information of each stage task execution. The following figure shows the execution of a complex pipeline: Product Management Products, often referred to as binary software artifacts, are the output of the build process, including software packages, test reports, application configuration files, etc. which can be run directly or can be viewed in binary form on the server. Product management is the management of the products generated during the software development process and is generally released and delivered as the final deliverable. All product packages and dependent components can be integrated into the product library for unified management. The product library should be the only source of trusted products for testing and production deployment. Different production languages produce different ways of acquiring, using, and sharing products. Different product libraries can manage binary products of their respective language types. SmartCMP embeds the leading binary product management repository Nexus into the code stream. Development organizations typically build product management systems for each project to make it easier and more convenient to acquire products and to achieve good performance for transferring large products over the network. Although developers use different types of code to develop build tools and testers use different types of test tools, software product management systems specify warehouse types and product locations and handle all the complexities of getting the latest and correct products, reduce the complexity of the creation of automated pipeline releases and quickly get the right products to improve deployment efficiency. Endpoint Endpoint can add software product repositories that need to be connected, provide the source of the products at deployment time for the software components to be used, and define the docking of software packages or task schedules. A copy of the package that performs archiving or mirroring push operations in the pipeline will be stored at the product library. Connection with Nexus, Jenkins and other management platforms to the endpoint is supported. Copyright © 2013-2019 CloudChef. All Rights Reserved.
