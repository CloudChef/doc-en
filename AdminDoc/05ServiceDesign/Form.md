**Form**

When creating or configuring a service, you can select a form built into the system (IP pool creation form, project creation form allowing users to automate the creation of IP pools, projects, etc.). If you need to modify or add additional field information for users to apply for Fill in, you can customize the configuration form through the form designer. 

For example: apply for a new project, apply for an email account, apply for a resource pool, add an environment administrator. 

System built-in form:
+ IP pool Creation, which defines the information that users need to enter when they request to create a new IP pool.
+ Project Creation, which defines the information that users need to enter when they request to create a new project.
+ Attachments Uploading, use this when uploading the required materials for approval. The file size cannot exceed 500KB.
+ Resource pool expansion, which defines the information that users need to enter when requesting resource pool expansion.

The following describes the specific steps for adding a new form. After the field of the form configuration is completed, you can customize it when you apply for the service in the service catalog.
