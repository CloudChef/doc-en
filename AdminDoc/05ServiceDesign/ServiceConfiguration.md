**Service Configuration**

The software architect can publish the designed blueprint as a service, and the IT administrator can integrate the service with the internal processes and publish it to the service catalog. 
The main functions of the service items are:

>「Note」After the service is released, you can apply for the service through the service catalog. For details, see: [Service Catalog](https://cloudchef.github.io/doc-en/AdminDoc/06CloudServiceMgmt/ServiceCatalog.html)

 + Service is associated with a specified blueprint, business group

 + Service and service strategy relationships, such as service hours, leases, service processes, etc.

 + Service access settings

 + Integration of services with third-party systems, such as third-party approval processes, third-party billing processes, etc.

In the navigation bar on the left, choose Service Design – Catalog Config. The service list is displayed. The service name, description, blueprint design, service group, status, number of service deployments, and creation time are displayed. You can perform the following operations on the service configuration: add, edit, unpublish, delete, etc.

# Add a Service Configuration

You can add a service configuration by following the steps below:

1.  In the left navigation bar, select "Service desgin" - “Catalog Config” and click "Add".

2.  Fill in the service name, service description (optional), select the business group, service type. When the service type is cloud resource blueprint service, select the blueprint design. When selecting the manual ticket service, select the process selection and click " submit"

 Next, Introduce you to the specific steps of the cloud resource blueprint service configuration. For the specific steps of the manual ticket service configuration, please refer to: [Manual Ticket Service Configuration](https://cloudchef.github.io/doc-en/AdminDoc/08RequestServiceMgmt/#Manual%20Work%20Order%20Service%20Configuration)

>「Note」The description of the service configuration supports Markdown syntax writing rules to show the display format of different service descriptions during service request. 

3.  Fill in the following information on the "Overview" tab.


+ Name	Service item name
+ Description	Service item description
+ Logo	Service item logo selection, will be displayed in the service catalog after publishing
+ Business Group(read only)	  BG name
>Note：The service configuration can be set to a certain business group or shared to all business groups. When sharing to all business groups, some settings cannot be specified during service configuration. When a user applies for a service and a service group is specified, it will be determined by resources on the business group
+ Status (read only)
	Service item status
•	Published: Publish service items to the service catalog
•	Unpublished: Service item is not published
•	Expired: Service item has expired
+ Service Deployment Lease Time (Day)	After the service deployment lease time expires, all instances in the deployment will be shut down. The configurable lease time is set within the interval configured by the business group. Check "Allow modification" and "Modify only when approved".

+ Service deployment retention time (day)	After the retention time is reached, the deployment will be dismounted. The configurable retention time is set within the interval configured by the business group. Check "Allow modification" and "Modify only when approved". 

+ Enable association rules	  Support for forcibly distributing vSphere virtual machines to different physical machines or to the same physical machine



4.   Click the “Approval Configuration” tab to select the approval process (built-in default approval process or custom approval process, for example: parallel approval process), view approval process flow chart, approval process step

5.   Click the “Workflow” tab and select the service process (built-in standard cloud service deployment process or customized service process) to view the service flow chart and service process steps.

6.   Click the "Form " tab to select the form, form preview


7.   Click the Component Configuration tab to see the blueprint topology and all components in the configuration service:

There are three types of components in the component configuration list: computing components, software components, and network components:

 + Computational components: refer to servers or compute nodes such as Server, Windows Server, Instance, etc.

 + Software components configuration: applications that are typically placed on servers or compute nodes, such as Apache, MySQL, etc.

 + Network components: refer to the network configuration of the server, such as network

Component configuration:

 - Compute component configuration: You can add monitoring to the current node or server by selecting a virtual machine template with monitoring enabled

 - Software components: You can add monitoring points to enable monitoring. The nodes where the software components are located must be enabled for monitoring, and the monitoring of software components will take effect. After the monitored server or node and software components are deployed successfully, you can view the currently deployed monitoring data information on the Monitoring tab of the Deployment Details page. The corresponding node instance details page also has a node monitoring tab for the user to monitor the current node's data. At the same time, if the software component with monitoring points is installed in the current node, you can view the monitoring data of the software components by adding monitoring points.


## Cloud Resource Allocation Strategy

In the service configuration, configure the cloud resource configuration of the instance node. Pay attention to the resource bundle selection strategy. The platform mainly provides the following strategies:

+	Manual designation: Specify the resource bundle manually. If the resource bundle selection strategy selects “manual designation”, which supports the use of resource labels and narrows down the selection, the “resource bundle” selection item will appear. Select the resource bundle in the drop-down box and specify the resource bundle. You can choose to check "Allow modification" and "Only modify during approval". 

+	Automatically select the one with largest remaining capacity: The platform automatically selects the currently selectable resource bundle according to the policy, with the smallest resource usage and the largest remaining capacity.

+	Automatically select the lowest cost: The platform supports setting resource charging rules and selecting the currently selectable resource bundle according to the policy, with the lowest cost and the least cost.

+	Even Allocation: When services are deployed, resources are evenly distributed to different resource bundles.
