**Monitoring & Alert**

Alert provides the user with the virtual machine and any application self-service alert configuration.

In the left navigation, select "Monitoring & Alert". There are 5 secondary menus under the Monitoring & Alert, followed by "Alert Policy", "Alert Rules", "Triggered Alert", "Host Monitoring" and "Host Alerts".

# Component monitoring

After the monitoring data is collected, a unified interface needs to be provided for display. SmartCMP can not only display the monitoring information on the deployment or cloud resource interface, but also display the monitoring information uniformly on a brand new page. As a separate page, component monitoring displays the monitoring of applications, instances, or virtual machines.

+ For the specific steps of adding proxy components, please refer to:[Component Library](http://CMP-PUBLIC-IP/help/AdminDoc/05服务建模/组件库.html) 
+ Click "Monitoring & Alerts"-"Component Monitoring" on the left navigation bar, the tree structure of the Export component is displayed on the left, and the related Exporter (used to describe all the components of the Exporter. Each component can define its own supported component types.) is displayed on the right.
+ For example: Click on the NginxExporter displayed on the right to enter the "NginxExporter" tab, the left side of the page displays the NginxExporter related instance, and the right side displays the relevant description information of the NginxExporter component.
+ Instance Exporter provides an abstract component for monitoring different VMs. No matter what kind of virtual machine is monitored, it will be listed in Instance Exporter. Go to the "Instance Exporter" tab, the virtual machine instance associated with the Instance Exporter is displayed on the left of the page, and the monitoring information of the virtual machine is displayed on the right.

>「Note」 Component monitoring entitlement management: Every user can see the menu, but the scope of component resources that can be viewed is based on the user's configured entitlements in advance. For example, the tenant administrator sees the resources he owns and the business group administrator sees all resources in the business group he manages, etc. 



# Alert Policy

Used to define the conditions under which the selected object type (such as instance/application/container, etc.) triggers an alert. Click the second level menu "Alert Policy" under "Monitoring & Alerts" on the left navigation to display the alert policy list. The list includes the alert policy name, category, type (downtime, threshold or prediction), creation time, and creator. Users may add, edit, delete, etc. alert policies.

### Add an Alert Policy {#Add an Alert Policy .afff6}

1. In the navigation tree on the left, choose Alert Policy, enter the alert policy list interface, and click Add to enter the alert policy interface.

2. On the Add Alert Policy page, define the basic information of the alert policy. Enter the name of the alert policy in turn and select the alert category and alert type. The alert category supports alerts for instances, applications, and containers. The alert type supports downtime alerts, threshold alerts, and predicted alerts for instances, threshold alerts and predicted alerts for applications, thresholds for containers, and predictive alerts.

3. Define the triggering conditions of the alert policy according to different alert types selected.

Downtime alert: Input time (minutes). After the instance loses response within the specified time, it will trigger the downtime alert. 

Threshold alert: Select the maximum/minimum/average value of virtual machine/container’s indicator (such as memory usage (percentage), CPU usage (percentage), POD memory usage, etc.) in the past minutes/hours. If the value is less than / less than or equal to / greater than / greater than or equal to certain value, an alert will be triggered.

Predictive alert: Based on the value of the indicator in the past minutes / hours / days (such as memory usage (percentage), CPU usage (percentage), etc.), predict those in future time range (minutes / hours / days). If the value of the indicator is less than/less than or equal to / greater than / greater than or equal to certain value, an alert will be triggered.

4. Click "Save". The alert policy is added successfully and the alert policy list interface will be displayed.

2. Define basic information. Enter the name, select the alert policy, alert range, and alert level. After triggering xx times, it will automatically upgrade to a higher level. This supports alerts for business groups, projects, service deployments, and VMs. The alert object is based on the selected alert range and the alert level is warning and danger.

3. Define the user, role, or email address to be notified when the alert is triggered.

4. You can define the behavior after the alert is triggered. After triggering the behavior, you can set up to xx operations and stop the automatic execution.

Support instance expansion operations: shrink one node horizontally, scale one node horizontally, shut down, restart, expand 5G logical volume, increase 1G memory (vSphere), add 1 vCPU (vSphere), etc.
Support for the expansion of the container: reduce the number of 3 copies, increase the number of 2 copies, etc.


5. Click “Save” to return to the alert rules interface.

# Triggered Alert

Click "Triggered Alerts" to display the list of triggered alerts, including name, target, type, first trigger time, last trigger time, and alert status. The alert status is divided into firing, muted, and resolved. It is also possible to recover, pause, and release the triggered alerts in the list.

1. Select a triggered alert. "Pause" and "Relieve" in the toolbar will become available. Click "Pause", there will be a prompt. After confirmation it will shows that the operation is successful.

2. Click on the alert name in the list to view the historical data. This page shows the object triggered the alert, the level of the alert, the triggered condition, the business group, the owner, the IP address, the alert chart (the adjustable time range help flexibly view the alert data for each time period), and the subsequent operation history of the alert.

3. Objects triggered alerts can be linked, such as service deployment link to service deployment monitoring page, instance link to instance monitoring page, application link to service deployment monitoring page.

# Host Monitoring

On the Host Health page, users can see the health of the hosts in each platform in the current system. The running status of the host corresponds to three graphs: CPU usage (GHz), memory usage (GB), and storage usage (GB).

Users can set the time span to change the chart statistics. If there are multiple cloud platforms in the current system, users will see the labels of multiple cloud platforms. Clicking on different cloud platform tabs will jump to the data statistics page of the corresponding cloud platform, view the corresponding chart, and obtain the host information under the cloud platform.
