**Naming suffix**


Naming suffix is a component of the suffixes in the service deployment name naming rules, the virtual machine name naming rules, the Windows host name naming rules and the Linux host name naming rules in business groups. The naming suffix created by the tenant administrator can be shared with all business groups. The business group administrator can only create the naming suffix used by this business group.

View the current named suffix: Select "Infrastructure" on the left navigation and select the secondary menu "Naming suffix" to display the current naming suffix. Display suffix name, type (number or random string), length, initialization sequence, business group, etc.
