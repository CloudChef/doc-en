**Deployments**
+ After the user request the service, the cloud management platform will automatically deploy all cloud resources included in the service requested according to the strategy, such as a virtual machine, a database, or a multi-layered application environment. The user can use all the resources deployed by the service within the configured service lease period, and can perform self-service operation or changes according to the entitlements configured by the administrator.

+ Under the "Deployments" menu of the cloud management platform, implement service deployment according to strategy; view instances and cloud resources; select one or more service deployments or cloud resources to quickly perform authorized operations; optimize resource recovery process, support manual recycling and automatic recycling of resources according to policies. If there is an accidental deletion, resources and data can be retrieved through the recycle bin.
