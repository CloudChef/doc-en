 **Infrastructure**


SmartCMP uniformly manages various resources such as computing, storage, network, and application in the data center, including private cloud, public cloud, hybrid cloud, container cloud, and x86 physical machine. Supports rapid import and seamless management of inventory virtual machines, using cloud platform standard APIs to operate and manage cloud resources.

Because of the interaction between the API and various cloud infrastructures, the user's cloud infrastructure account is in a different form (such as public cloud using AccessKey, private cloud using username and password, etc.). 

>「Note」Different cloud infrastructure account acquisition methods are different. For details, please refer to: [Add a Cloud Platform](https://cloudchef.github.io/doc-en/AdminDoc/03Infrastructure/CloudPlatformManagement.html#add-a-cloud-platform).

Tenant administrator can complete the registration of the infrastructure by adding access information for the corresponding infrastructure.
