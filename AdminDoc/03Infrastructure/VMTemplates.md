**VM Templates**

The platform supports the creation of virtual machine templates. One operating system can correspond to multiple virtual machine templates. A virtual machine template is associated with a template or image in the cloud platform

-   Templates in vSphere vCenter

-   Images on the OpenStack platform

-   Operating system (OS) images for each area of the public cloud platform

The installation mode and account information of the two SmartCMP agents can be configured in the VM template. The two agents are monitoring agents and automation agents.

Some of the automation features of SmartCMP rely on automation agents such as:

-   Blueprint with application deployment or adding disks

-   Service configuration initializes and mounts disks, creating new users 

-   Part of virtual machine operations (including resetting passwords, executing scripts, stopping applications, adding, expanding Linux logical volumes or Windows disks, etc.).

Once a virtual machine template is created, it can be specified directly in the service configuration. SmartCMP automatically recognizes virtual machine templates based on the cloud platform on which the blueprint objects are located.

>「Note」Please use the tenant administrator or infrastructure administrator account to log in to SmartCMP platform. Tenant administrators can assign an infrastructure administrator role to a user. By default, three virtual machine templates are created: Windows 2012 R2, Redhat 7, and CentOS 7. You need to add the corresponding cloud platform information to use.



# Add VM Templates

Here we define two virtual machine templates: Windows 2012 R2 and CentOS 7.

## Add a Linux VM Template

1.  Select Infrastructure - VM Template to enter the VM template list interface. Click "Add", enter the operating system name, description, select the system type Linux, click "Submit"

2.  Click the VM Template tab to enter the VM template list interface

### Add a vSphere VM Template{#Add a vSphere VM Template}

1.  ①	On the VM template list page, click Add. Enter the VM template name, select a vSphere cloud platform, and configure the following:

Clone mode: "Full clone" or "Linked clone"

 >「Note」 Full clone is a completely independent copy of the original virtual machine, it does not share any resources with the original virtual machine, can be used independently from the original virtual machine while linked clones need to share the same virtual disk file with the original virtual machine, cannot be separated from the original virtual machine running independently. But using shared disk files greatly reduces the time it takes to create a cloned virtual machine, while also saving valuable physical disk space.

- Full clone:  Template: Select a Linux CentOS template

- Linked clone: Virtual Machine: Select a template for Linux CentOS 7. Snapshot mode: “Specify a snapshot” by default, you can select two snapshot modes: “Select when applying” and “Always use the latest”. Select "Select when applying" to select a virtual machine snapshot at the time of service request. Snapshot: If the snapshot mode selects “Specify a Snapshot”, a snapshot will be selected.

-   SSH is enabled in the template: Check this option to enable SSH in the template. You can choose to install the monitoring agent and the automation agent through SSH. The default SSH port is 22. If the SSH port is modified in the template, Enter the modified SSH port number in the template.

-   Username and password: If you choose to enable SSH, fill in the user with SSH permission and its password 

-   Monitoring method: No monitoring: The monitoring function of the platform is not available if the monitoring agent is not installed. SSH monitoring agent: If you choose to install SSH, you will access the virtual machine through SSH and install the monitoring agent. Set the monitoring port. The default is 9100. Pre-installation monitoring agent: Pre-installation means that the monitoring agent is already installed in the template. Cloud platform monitoring: directly read the monitoring data of the virtual machine from the vCenter, no need to install the monitoring agent.

-   Install the automation agent: Do not install: If you do not install an automated agent, some of the platform's automation features will not be available, such as blueprints with application deployment or disks adding, some virtual machine operations such as resetting passwords, executing scripts, etc. SSH installation: Select SSH installation, access virtual machine via SSH and install automation agent. Pre-installation: Pre-installation means that an automation agent is already installed in the template.
