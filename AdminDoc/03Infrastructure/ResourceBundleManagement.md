**Resource Bundle Management**


The infrastructure administrator manages the private cloud, the public cloud, the hybrid cloud, the container, the physical machine, and the mainstream network resources, and pools various resources to form a resource bundle.

The administrator allocates the resource bundle to the business group to implement the segmentation of the cloud platform resources. You can specify the resource bundle to use the specific resources of the target cloud platform. For example, you can customize the resource bundle to associate the storage resource and network resource with the development resource bundle. Through the resource bundle, specify the resource quotas that can be used, such as the total number of virtual machines allowed to be deployed, the total amount of vCPUs allowed, the total amount of memory, and so on.


# Add a Resource Bundle

After the cloud platform is successfully added, the cloud platform resources are divided into one or more resource bundles, and the corresponding resource quotas are allocated to different business groups. The relationship between resource bundles and business groups is divided into three types:

1.  Resource bundle is only assigned to a unique business group

2.  Resource bundle is assigned to all business groups, and the newly added business group automatically associates the resource bundle

3.  Resource bundles are shared to multiple business groups

+  Support resource bundle replication. Usage scenarios: When an administrator configures multiple clusters for vCenter, each business group needs to configure these clusters as resource bundles, allowing administrators to quickly create resource bundles with the same or similar configuration. Specific operation steps: In the left navigation, select "Infrastructure" and select "Resource Bundle Management". In the list of resource bundles, select a resource bundle and click the copy button (When multiple resource bundles are selected, the copy button will not work.) to generate a new resource bundle creation page. The name of the copied resource is automatically changed to "<original resource bundle name> -1" (for example, the original resource bundle name is vSphereDemo, and the copied one is vSphereDemo-1). All configurations are the same as the original resource bundle. The administrator can modify the related parameters of the original resource bundle, including the assigned business group and the sharing mode. 

+  Support resource bundle enable or disable. When the administrator is creating and editing a resource bundle, a selection button is added below the priority to enable the resource bundle, which is selected by default. Resource bundles, whether enabled or disabled, can be assigned to business groups. After disabling, when deploying cloud resources, the selection of this resource bundle is not supported, but the existing resources are not affected in any way.




## Add a vSphere Resource Bundle {#AddavSphereResourceBundle}

You can add a vSphere resource bundle by following the steps below: 

1.  In the left navigation, select “Infrastructure” and select the secondary menu “Resource Bundles”. Click the "Add" button and select "vSphere". The Create Resource Bundle interface will appear. Follow the form to fill in the relevant information and save it.
