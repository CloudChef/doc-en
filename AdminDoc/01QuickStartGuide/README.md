**Admin Quick Start Guide**


SmartCMP mainly has two service scenarios, one is the cloud resource blueprint service scenario; the other is the ticket service scenario. 
+	Cloud resource blueprint service scenario
The Cloud Resource Blueprint Service is based on blueprint modeling to define standard service frameworks and components, providing a rich set of out-of-the-box software components to visualize blueprints for automated deployment.
For example, configuring a vSphere single-node virtual machine service is a typical scenario for a cloud resource blueprint service.
After the blueprint is modeled by the administrator, the service configuration can specify the resources and parameters that the user can apply for, and form a standard service based on the blueprint. After the release, the user can apply for self-service and automate the delivery.

+	Ticket service scenario
There are two types of ticket services:
1. Apply for non-standardized resources (for example, apply for a cloud resource blueprint service to uninstall a service deployment. This action is a typical service scenario for ticket services) 
2. Services that require IT manual intervention (for example, manual ticket service for resetting passwords. This action is also a typical service scenario for ticket services)

>「Note」Please refer to [Quick Configuration of Cloud Resource Blueprint Services](#QuickConfigurationofCloudResourceBlueprintServices) for more cloud resource blueprint services. For detailed ticket service please go to [Request service Management](https://cloudchef.github.io/doc-en/AdminDoc/08RequestServiceMgmt/)


When using the system release service for the first time, you need to do the following to configure the system:

1.  Configure the cloud platform portal: administrator login information such as vSphere and OpenStack. 

2.  Add IP Pool: Define the range of available IP addresses

3.  Define resource bundles: configure available physical resources and set quotas, such as CPU, memory, storage, network, etc. 

4.  Define business groups, associated personnel, resource bundles, configuration approval process, deployment specifications, etc.

5.  Define virtual machine templates: Select the cloud platform and the corresponding template or image

6.  Define blueprints: define the architecture of the service and automate the installation logic

7.  Configure and publish the service: associate the blueprint to the service group and resource bundle, and configure the deployment parameters, such as selecting a VM template.

8.  Request service: Apply for service in the service catalog. You can also enable the guided application function of the business group in the "Organization" - "Business Groups"

9.  Self-service operation: View detailed information about service deployment, instances or cloud resources in Deployment menu, and perform self-service operation. 

The next chapter will explain how the administrator configures the first cloud resource, publishes and requests the service.

# Define Business Group


A business group is a logical organization structure within a tenant. SmartCMP supports the creation of a multi-level business group for the organization structure of the enterprise within the system. The business group associates the user to which the business group belongs and the resource bundles that the business group can use.

A business group is a logical concept. Entities that need to associate users, service catalogs, and resource quotas can be associated with business groups, such as subsidiaries, departments at different levels, and so on. 

Default business group and tenant administrator, business group administrator, and business group members are created by default. Resource bundles can be assigned by the following steps:

>「Note」If you need to modify the settings of this business group or create a new business group, please refer to the detailed steps in [Organization](https://cloudchef.github.io/doc-en/AdminDoc/04Organization/)

1.  Click “Organization” - “Business Groups” and click the business group name (Default) to enter the editing page

2.  Overview page, keep the default value

3.  User page: keep the default value. By default, two users are set up as business group administrators and business group member.

4.  Resource Bundles: click Add, select the vSphere resource bundle and OpenStack resource bundle created in the previous section, and click OK.

5.  Click Save to associate the business group with the resource bundle.

6.  Apply for resource and service association approval process for the business group, set naming rules and request specification. 

7.  Configure cloud resource operations entitlement and service deployment operations entitlement for business group members 

8.  Configure resources and budget quotas for business group members

# Define Virtual Machine Template


The platform supports the creation of virtual machine templates. One operating system can correspond to multiple virtual machine templates, and one virtual machine template can be used in multiple cloud platforms. The virtual machine template is associated with a template in the vSphere platform or an image in the OpenStack platform. 

The installation mode and account information of the two SmartCMP agents can be configured in the VM template. The two agents are monitoring agents and automation agents. Some automation features in the SmartCMP platform rely on automated agents. 

For example: blueprint with application deployment or disk addition, service configuration initialization with disk mounted and new users created and some virtual machine operations (including reset password, execute script, application start & stop, add and extend Linux logical volume or Windows Disk, etc.). 

Once a virtual machine template is created, it can be specified directly in the service configuration. SmartCMP automatically recognizes virtual machine templates based on the cloud platform on which the blueprint objects are located.

Here defines two virtual machine templates: CentOS 7 and Windows 2012 R2.

>「Note」Please use the tenant administrator or infrastructure administrator to log in to SmartCMP. Tenant administrators can assign an infrastructure administrator role to a user. By default, three virtual machine templates are created: Windows 2012 R2, Redhat 7, and CentOS 7. You need to add the corresponding cloud platform information to use.

 >「Note」Users can see the list of allowed operations after the deployment is generated only if the operating entitlement of the virtual machine is configured when the business group is set or the service is configured. Default business group defaults all operations to the business group administrator and there is no approval process.

3.  Click on the name to view the details of the service deployment including "Basic Information", " Topology", "Operation History" and "Monitoring" (Monitoring of VMs and Application Components)

  + Basic Information: Includes name, business group, project, blueprint, resource bundle, cloud platform, and related information such as cost, status, and time. It also includes a list of input parameters for the service deployment and output result information. After the service deployment fails, some scenarios can be repaired offline. If the repair is successful, the service deployment status will be changed to "Running".

  + Topology: Includes blueprints, details, and process information for service deployment. Hovering over the service topology map will display the key information of the node. For example, the server node will display the instance name, guest operating system, IP address, memory, total disk space, number of vCPUs, CPU usage, memory usage, etc.

  + History: Shows the operation history of the service deployment

  + Monitoring: Shows monitoring information for instances and application components in the deployment.
