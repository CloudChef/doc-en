# Bastion Host{#Bastion Host}

SmartCMP supports accessing virtual machines through bastion hosts and scheduling various bastion hosts through a unified HTTP request.

Core usage scenarios: 

Permission management: Integrate the access control of the bastion host and the platform (the platform and the bastion host are connected to the permission system, set user permissions, and set whether users can connect to the virtual machine through SSH or RDP. 

User management: all users accessing the virtual machine need to go through the bastion host. 

Operations: after the virtual machine is created, register the virtual machine to the bastion host; after the virtual machine is deleted, log out the virtual machine from the bastion host; after the virtual machine changes, update the bastion host. For example when a virtual machineâ€™s owner is changed, the registration information of the virtual machine in the bastion host is modified synchronously.

Specific configuration steps:

+	The specific steps of bastion host entrance connection to GuacaMole (that is, Apache Guacamole): click on the left navigation bar "Security Audit"-"Bastion Host", click add, fill in the bastion host information, name (virtual machine name), description , Guacd address (that is, the URL link of the bastion host), Guacd port (that is, the access port of the bastion host), SmartCMP uses Cloudchef-Integration to verify that the login information is correct. 
+	Bind the bastion host to the resource bundle: Click the "Infrastructure"-"Resource Bundle Management" on the left navigation bar, and specify one of the bastion hosts that have been connected. For example: when adding a vSphere resource bundle, bind the bastion host Guacd, the virtual machine deployed using the vSphere resource bundle will be automatically registered to the bastion host, and the virtual machine deployed using the vSphere resource bundle will be automatically unregistered from the bastion host when it is uninstalled. 
+	Use of the bastion host. After the vSphere resource bundle is bound to the bastion host, use the vSphere resource bundle to successfully deploy the instance. Click the left navigation bar "Deployments"-"Instance"-"Overview" tab, select Remote protocol types, including: based on cloud platform, RDP or VNC (choose based on RDP or VNC, you need to select the remote protocol port). After the selection is completed, click "Remote Terminal" and you can directly pass "RDP or VNC". The instance is configured to open the remote terminal on the cloud platform. You can modify the parameters of the protocol information through the remote terminal, for example, modify the user name and password of the virtual machine.



# Backup system{#Backup system}

SmartCMP supports fast and reliable backup of all instances on the vSphere cloud platform based on Veeam. Configure the backup management platform and bind the resource bundle to the backup management platform. The instances deployed in this resource bundle can be managed by Veeam. Supports recovery of individual files, entire virtual machines, applications, and more, ensuring service security and high availability.

Core usage scenarios: 

+	Backup: It is an instant backup (that is, manual backup). Click this operation to trigger a backup operation. The backup parameters may include the name of the backup file. The parameters need to be configured. You can view the execution process and results of backup operations (successful or failed backups) in the operation history. 

    For example: backup the current entire instance, similar to taking a snapshot

+	Restore: Supports selecting a backup point and restoring in the current instance (The backup point is a list, allowing the user to select the name of the backup file, time information, more additional parameters need to be configured in the form. Click on the backup point and trigger the restoration process restoring the data of the backup point to the current instance.) The execution process and result of the restoration operation (successful restoration or failure) can be viewed in the operation history. 
    
    For example: a backup copy of the instance is restored to the current cloud virtual machine


Specific configuration steps: 

+	Backup management portal configuration: Click "Security Audit"-"Backup Management Platform" on the left navigation bar, click Add, fill in Veeam information, name (name of Veeam system platform), description, Veeam address (i.e. URL link of Veeam platform) , Username and password (i.e. login username and password for Veeam platform) 

+	Bind to the resource bundle: Click the "Infrastructure"-"Resource bundle Management" cloud platform resource information tab on the left navigation bar to specify the backup management platform that has been connected. For example, when adding a vSphere resource bundle, bind the backup management platform Veeam, and the virtual machines deployed using the vSphere resource bundle will be automatically associated with Veeam, and the instance will be managed through the backup management platform. 

+	Backup and restore operations. After the vSphere resource bundle is bound to the backup management platform Veeam, the instance successfully deployed using the vSphere resource bundle. Click Deployments"-"Instances" on the left navigation bar. Support basic "Backup" / "Restore" operation. 



# Audits


Support records of user access and operation information. The tenant administrator and sysadmin have this permission by default. If you need to add this permission to other roles, please add a role and add this permission. 

For details, see [Roles](https://cloudchef.github.io/doc-en/AdminDoc/04Organization/Roles.html)

Click "System Management"-"Operation Audit" on the left navigation bar, you can see the operation records of the tenant. It displays the operator, operation object, operation name, operation parameter, status, and operation time. You can use "Advanced Search" for quick filtering and positioning. It supports the filtering of operators, statuses, operating objects,and start and end times. You can also use ordinary search functions.
